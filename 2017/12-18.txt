aiwakura, amazing

1513560696
andrewrk
you are alive

1513560810
aiwakura
I am

1513560815
aiwakura
very much so :D

1513560868
aiwakura
error.OutOfMemory doesn't work either

1513561008
aiwakura
also next commit on master will be #2000

1513561023
aiwakura
cheers to that

1513561119
aiwakura
var block = searchFreeBlock(size) ?? return error.OutOfMemory;

1513561155
aiwakura
undeclared error value 'OutOfMemory'. maybe it's not defined in kernel space? should I define my own?

1513561500
aiwakura
also, signature for fmt.format has changed, correct?

1513561804
andrewrk
one moment

1513561959
aiwakura
fmt.format I solved, I just need to solve the OutOfMemory thingy

andrewrk
what a boring #2000 commit

1513562054
aiwakura
hahahaha

1513562059
aiwakura
well it's the thing that fixes my build

1513562062
andrewrk
no worries, because #2001 is so far:  43 files changed, 877 insertions(+), 868 deletions(-)

1513562636
aiwakura
wow

1513562644
aiwakura
what is that?

1513562919
andrewrk
the fix to

1513562939
andrewrk
exporting things is going to get a little more verbose and a lot more powerful

1513563081
aiwakura
I see

1513563097
aiwakura
(zen builds now!)

1513563180
andrewrk
great, and the behavior is ok too?

1513563187
aiwakura
yeah everything looks good

1513563224
aiwakura
the big task ahead is to add zen support to the standard library

1513563243
aiwakura
I wanted to hack on that for my week at RC, but I still haven't heard from them

1513563265
aiwakura
thinking of buying the tickets for NYC anyway and just work the nights there anyway, lol

1513563421
andrewrk
:D

1513563480
andrewrk
a prerequisite for zen support in the std lib is

1513563515
andrewrk
because right now we have a 1:1 mapping with @import("builtin").Os and LLVM's OS enum

1513563523
aiwakura
yeah, I remember you sending me this link before

1513563524
andrewrk
and we need to make it not a 1:1 mapping

1513563802
aiwakura
I see

1513564198
andrewrk
aiwakura, I have a request for zen's kernel API

1513564208
andrewrk
never use null terminated buffers for anything

1513564214
andrewrk
always accept a length parameter

1513569781
aiwakura
sounds reasonable

1513570039
andrewrk
I'm about to push this export change

1513570306
aiwakura
is it gonna cause breakage?

1513570496
andrewrk
I'm going to submit a pull request to you that fixes the breakage before I push

1513570610
aiwakura
oh sweet, thanks

1513570851
andrewrk
trying to make your code work with this commit revealed that I need to make a few more changes and add a few more tests before it's ready

1513570861
andrewrk
I'm going for dinner, back in a bit
