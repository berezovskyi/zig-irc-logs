whats the motivation for only being able to pass structs/enums via pointer?

i'm just curious why since structs are passed by value in go so i assume there's a tradeoff but maybe not.  Is it always faster than copying?

it's so that there's only 1 way to do it

you can't wonder which way is faster

passing by value involves a hidden memcpy

if you need a copy, make a copy
