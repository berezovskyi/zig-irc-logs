no, without libc it acts the same way

1508025627
andrewrk
oh

1508025640
pupp
os puts something on stack that closes app

1508025655
pupp
it's not really documented anywhere, but seems that it just works

1508025689
pupp
some people prefer to not depend on not documented behaviour, I see no reason to not depend on it

1508025747
andrewrk
in this case probably exporting WinMainCRTStartup is probably what you want

1508025802
pupp
so just replacing WinMain with WinMainCRTStartup will work?

1508025854
andrewrk
let me try it

1508026059
andrewrk
I will add a couple lines of code to the compiler to make it work

1508026364
andrewrk
pupp, with the change I just pushed it works

zig/master fd7654e Andrew Kelley: build-exe allows direct export of WinMainCRTStartup

1508026383
andrewrk
however, I noticed that not calling ExitProcess resulted in the process staying alive in task manager

1508026554
pupp
I'll check what's up with that tomorrow

1508026580
andrewrk
I'm about to do the text color attribute change, will you be around for 10 min to test it?

1508026597
pupp
ok

1508026607
pupp
should I rebuild it?

1508026621
andrewrk
yes after I push, but I have not pushed yet

1508026745
pupp
by the way, it's weird that 32bit exe loads at address 1210000, they usually start at 400000

1508026754
pupp
it's sort of tradition.

1508026759
andrewrk
I think we can pass a linker flag to change this

1508027530
andrewrk
pupp, see if this makes console colors work for you?

1508027539
andrewrk
you should be able to do `make install` from the build directory to rebuild

1508028178
pupp
it takes him suspiciously long to link Zig.exe

1508028213
pupp
I guess I'll have to do it tomorrow after all

1508028263
pupp
it generated zig.exe though

1508028271
pupp
trying it out

1508028284
andrewrk
it links much faster with msvc

1508028398
pupp
make finished instantly, make install took forever

1508028447
pupp
nah, doesn't run, did something wrong

1508028453
pupp
tomorrow

1508028457
