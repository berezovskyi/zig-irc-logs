Damn andrewrk, that was fast.

There's some issue with the full .h file though

C:\SW\zig\zig-nrf-demo\test.zig:2:13: error: compiler bug: @cImport generated invalid zig code const nrf = @cImport({             ^ ?.c:1:1: note: expected pointer, found 'c_ulong' TODO: remember C source location to display here

I put up the header files I've tested here:

const nrf = @cImport({     @cDefine("__GNUC__", "4");     @cDefine("NRF51", "");     @cInclude("nrf.h"); });

I updated the repository with the test-code and build script (using build-ldd.bat now) too. The cImport stuff is commented out though

Litte-endian bit packing is still not correct btw, but I don't think I saw a commit related to it so you probably knew that

FYI, it looks like Nordic Semiconductor will update the startup assembly file to be compatible with LLVM in a future SDK release :)

skyfex, yeah I thought that might happen. The problem with the code as is is that it guesses that the type of the thing to cast is a pointer, when it's actually a unsigned long in this case

I'll see if I can have it look up the type

Don't worry too much about it for my sake, just letting you know what I find when playing around :)

cImport is really a killer feature when porting C code. I'm already impressed
