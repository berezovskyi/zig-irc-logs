andrewrk: are there any plans to add unions in the future?  it would be handy for interpreting events of different types off of the event loop (timers vs. sockets vs. fs stuff, etc.), because all we get back is a void * and we need to figure out the right way to handle them.  i have some ways of hacking around it but unions would be a nice approach

andrewrk: I have question about metaprogramming. Is it possible (in compile time) to take a struct, add another member into it, and then rename the result with original name. "Mocking" datatype, in practice. Is is also possible to add/replace struct method this way?

oh wait, it looks like they already are supported

brend0n: yes unions are planned. I don't have the issue handy

andrewrk
The enum type supports data payloads

1510438808
andrewrk
Raw unions are also planned

1510438887
andrewrk
PV_: no this is not possible. It will likely be possible to do that and create a new type, but not override an existing one

andrewrk: the enum type was actually perfect for my use case (and most, i imagine)
