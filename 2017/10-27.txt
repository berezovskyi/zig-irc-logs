nevermind, figured out what was wrong. I've got non-static linking fully working on Windows now I think. Will get static linking working and create a PR.

Dimenus, llvm 5 has a bug that causes assertions to trip when they shouldn't

andrewrk
you have to use a release build of llvm/clang 5

1509146635
andrewrk
it should be fixed with the next release, for example in llvm6 branch I am working on getting all the assertions fixed
