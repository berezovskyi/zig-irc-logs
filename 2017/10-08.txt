pupp, I haven't tried that yet. so far I have things working with msvc:

Elronnd, compile time code execution, type as a value, and the ++ and ** (compile-time only) operators are meant to make a preprocessor unnecessary

tankfeeder, if a zig generated binary runs OK but crashes when compressed with upx, I think that is a upx bug

but if there is something zig can do to make a better binary, we can do that. maybe we can work with upx developers to find out the issue

tankfeeder, tell when you file a upx issue and I will comment on it too
