is there a supported way to pass structs by value?  i'm getting the following compilation error:

fn conn_handler(md: event.EventMd, context: &ListenerContext) -> %void {

/home/brendon/zig/std/event/net_test.zig:45:26: error: type 'EventMd' is not copyable; cannot pass by value

EventMd is just an fd (i32)

i have a number of ways of hacking around this so it's not a blocker atm; i'm just wondering whether it's intended that structs are never copyable and whether there's currently a way to explicitly indicate that a developer wants to pass a struct by value

FYI, the hello world example on the home page seems to be out of date
