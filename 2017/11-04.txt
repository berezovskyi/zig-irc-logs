I think the options might be better as build-obj

1509753613

rather than build-exe

unable to rename object file into final output: file system error

1509753693
tiehuis
yeah, got that same error

1509753767
tiehuis
also, build-obj assumes we are linking together object files in this case so we cant emit asm without errors

1509753798
tiehuis
since I didn't bother adding any of the generated output as link arguments when generating that assembly

1509753817
tiehuis
would it be suitable to just not link in codegen_link when there are no objects, or is there a better way?

1509753838
andrewrk
I don't understand what you mean about assuming we are linking together object files

1509753857
tiehuis
with this command `zig build-obj t.zig --output example.asm --emit asm`

1509753880
andrewrk
oh, I haven't tried that yet

1509754081
andrewrk
here's a more verbose error message

zig/master 4a6df04 Andrew Kelley: slightly more verbose error message when building object file fails

1509754203
andrewrk
tiehuis, I think all this junk in the .s file made with --emit asm is from debug info

1509754209
andrewrk
if we fixed --strip it might look better

1509754239
tiehuis
what are the steps to fix strip?

1509754258
andrewrk
I haven't looked at it yet, but it should be straightforward

1509754279
andrewrk
I'm thinking that, we abstract debug info a little bit, and if strip is on, we don't even create LLVM IR that has debug info

1509754504
tiehuis
that object rename issue seems pretty simple. I'll see if I can create the directories first for the output

1509754516
andrewrk
I don't know what is causing the crash vint  but I bet it's something simple

1509754523
andrewrk
*crash with --strip
