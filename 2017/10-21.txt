I think manual memory management isnt that bothersome. It's the safety that is important, either I want total safety from a GC, from a perfect memory leak detection system or from some other type of static analysis like Rust. Just telling me "dont make mistakes" is really not enough in 2017 (imo)

Is there any intent for ziglang.org to publish a public key and use it to sign downloads?

Hi Graven

zignube, the downloads are over https

1508602012
andrewrk
I'll see how much work it is to make the whole site https

1508602377
zignube
andrewrk: I'll take that as a "No" then. Interesting looking language, I hope it succeeds.

1508602536
andrewrk
zignube, I mean you can always compile it yourself. That's the only way to be 100% sure the private key wasn't compromised

1508602618
andrewrk
typically the way that package managers solve this problem is to save the hash of the download once, verify the contents, and make sure future downloads match that hash

1508602752
zignube
zignube: well, yes, that would be preferable to downloading a binary I guess, but I'd still feel safer with that signature. Perhaps I misunderstand, but it would tend to avoid trouble like that reported here,

I'm only looking at the URL, but this is relevant only if malware gains root access

1508602854
zignube
Oh sorry, s/zignube:/andrewrk:/

1508602904
zignube
andrewrk: I daresay you're right. Thanks for answering my question.

1508602911
andrewrk
I'll try to work binary signing into future releases

1508602918
andrewrk
it's a bit of work to set up

1508602961
andrewrk
right now ziglang.org provides a hosting service for release binaries but not a verification service

1508603087
zignube
andrewrk: I don't mean to be more annoying than necessary, but.. isn't it just a matter of adding a .sig file alongside the main download? The pub key I guess you'd need to publish for a while to get it established, so to speak, so if an attacker tries to replace it too then people can notice something odd happened. Not trivial in all, I have to admit.

1508603111
andrewrk
zignube, and why is that .sig file to be trusted and not the binary served by the exact same host?

1508603136
andrewrk
if an attacker can compromise the binary download, they can compromise the .sig download

1508603144
andrewrk
and provide their public key instead of mine

1508603217
zignube
andrewrk: they can indeed do those things. But when I verify, my gpg installation will warn me that the signature isn't one I have in my keyring, assuming I already downloaded your valid public key. That would make me wonder what's going on and probably come here to ask.

1508603268
zignube
If that makes sense... I mean, provided I have your valid public key, an attacker can't sneak past that.

1508603273
andrewrk
interesting, that's pretty reasonable

1508603324
zignube
Well, unless that attacker gets your private key too. That would be bad, but if you can make a new programming language I'm pretty sure you're clever enough to keep a key safe.

andrewrk: i have some ideas / comments which are a bit too off-topic for the llvm mailing list, but i'm happy to discuss them here

setting the OS/ABI in the elf header to FreeBSD allows the hello world to run as expected, so doesn't seem a major

1508626574

mjacob, I'd like to hear them

although I'm going to be AFK for a while

mjacob, there is also

1508626768

I can respond asynchronously

1508626828

sure, i'll will wrote down the idea and we can defer the "interactive discussion" to later
