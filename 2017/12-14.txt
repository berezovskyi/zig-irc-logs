andrewrk: Do you have any microcontroller devkits?

1513266359
andrewrk
skyfex, I do not

1513267070

andrewrk: I'm thinking of sending you a micro:bit. I might I have a spare. It's one of the simplest devkits out there.

neat! does that include hardware?

It's basically a debugger and nrf51 chip on a tiny board with an LED matrix, two buttons, and accelerometer+compass

1513267353

The debugger can be connected via USB, and shows up as a USB disk. You just put a .hex or .bin file there and that programs the nrf51 microcontroller

The debugger can also be used for proper debugging with ARM Kiel uVision

and probably GDB etc.

that sounds intruiging

1513267400
andrewrk
if you sent me a kit I'd definitely get a demo project going

1513267430
skyfex
It's meant for teaching kids to program, but I find it's really good for more advanced hobby projects too

1513267462
skyfex
I'll check and get back to you if I find a spare. I bought 10 a while back

Oh, also the debugger has a UART connection to the nRF51 microcontroller too. It shows up as a plain USB COM port

1513267615
skyfex
So that's how I did Hello World

1513267646
skyfex
I've made some progress with the demo. I've gotten interrupts to work, and have improved the UART driver to use interrupts

andrewrk
nice! I still need to work on the compiler-rt issues and bit fields

1513267909

Is there support for inline assembly?

1513267932
andrewrk
yes

1513267972
andrewrk
I still need to add docs for that, but you can grep the compiler source code for "asm" and ask any questions

1513267982
andrewrk
grep the standard library, I mean

thanks, found it :)

I have some improvements in mind for inline assembly:
