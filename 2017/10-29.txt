dimenus: nice work! Now static linking works with and without libc on Windows (with your improvements)

1509236524
andrewrk
dimenus: try this:

1509236548
andrewrk
zig parsec --verbose-cimport foo.c

1509236568
andrewrk
Where foo.c has macros or whatever you want to test

1509236600
andrewrk
I think for macros we don't emit warnings when we can't translate one. You would have to use a debugger on zig to find out why

1509236621
andrewrk
I should write some docs about the kinds of c macros we can translate

1509238293
tiehuis
andrewrk: the question was mainly because so far I've seen '*' only used to dereference and '&' used to denote pointers (as in function arguments).

1509238379
tiehuis
it seemed like a slight inconsistency with what I initially expected compared to other parts of the language

andrewrk: thanks, I'll check that out.

one more question, does it make sense to coalesce lib search paths similar to gcc/clang? meaning it's not separate flag for an individual libc lib

1509264764
pupp
made gdb pretty printer for zig source code,

1509264787
pupp
just for looking at Buf strings

1509264824
tiehuis
cool, looks like it'd help a lot!

1509264837
tiehuis
should be easy to extend to ArrayList's and similar yeah?

1509264857
pupp
dunno about easy, but should be possible

1509264910
tiehuis
i'll try this out when i need to debug something and see how it fares

1509264954
pupp
zig_llvm.cpp/bool ZigLLDLink, need to figure out how to see lld arguments here

1509264965
pupp
I printed them one by one last time

1509265029
tiehuis
is this during the cmake build?

1509265059
tiehuis
because if so you can check 'build/CmakeFiles/zig.dir/link.txt' for the linker command used to compile the compiler

1509265067
tiehuis
if that is what you are interested in looking at

1509265087
tiehuis
oh sorry, this is when compiling zig source code

1509265090
tiehuis
right?

1509265101
pupp
I'm interested in how zig compiles .zig programs

1509265113
pupp
it uses lld internally

1509265147
tiehuis
have you tried '--verbose-link'?

1509265148
pupp
ZigLLDLink is where zig talks with lld

1509265155
tiehuis
outputs the lld command used

1509265157
pupp
yes, zig crashed

1509265176
pupp


1509265197
pupp
actually, I did "--verbose --verbose-link --verbose-ir"

1509265207
pupp
need to try just --verbose-link now

1509265247
tiehuis
i don't expect this would crash by itself seeing what it does in the source

1509265349
pupp
it compiles more than it should, for some reason

1509265414
pupp
with all those verbose flags, it somehow compiles more

1509265419
pupp
than without them

1509265453
tiehuis
that, is odd, although i haven't really done anything on windows so am unaware of particular places and hiccups about

1509265802
pupp
I'm using rare version of everything, there are all sorts of wonder happening.
