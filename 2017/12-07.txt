andrewrk, is the build.zig program JIT'd by llvm?

dimenus, it's built statically like any exe and then executed as a child process

It's expected that a define like this is not handled by the Zig import system?

#define NRF_GPIO                        ((NRF_GPIO_Type           *) NRF_GPIO_BASE)

(I would expect it's a bit difficult to get it to work, so I'm not sure it's worthy trying. Maybe there could be some warning though)

skyfex, we could get that  to work. we need to expand the C macro parsing code

1512660218
andrewrk
you're right, too, maybe we should turn on warnings when we cannot translate a macro

1512660278
andrewrk
there would be a lot of warnings just from the standard lib includes though
