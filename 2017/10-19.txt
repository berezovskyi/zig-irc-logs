I know maybe half of those?

Elronnd: Fixed the build issues on FreeBSD, seemed as though llvm-config was adding that bad libexecinfo linker argument

1508394610
Elronnd
hmmm

1508394616
Elronnd
I'll complain to the fbsd folks

1508395173
Elronnd
tiehuis: I just pulled, and checked out 'freebsd'.  Still getting the '/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lLLVMLTO' issues

1508395429
tiehuis
okay, i haven't encountered that one on a fresh freebsd install unfortunately

1508395725
Elronnd


1508395801
Elronnd
what packages did you install?

1508396260
tiehuis
one second

1508396278
tiehuis
and just the default llvm50 from pkg and other standard ones

1508396512
tiehuis
let me try a debug build, i've been doing a release the whole time:

1508396753
tiehuis
alright, can reproduce it on a debug build

1508402741
Elronnd
ohh

1508402748
Elronnd
yeah Ive been doing debug builds

1508402799
tiehuis
i'm going to look more into it tomorrow. I'm pretty sure a Release build statically links everything together hence some differences.

1508402894
Elronnd
ok

1508419996
andrewrk
Elronnd, tiehuis: note that we don't support debug builds of llvm currently because of a bug in llvm causing an invalid assertion. Should be fixed with the next llvm release.

1508420020
andrewrk
Or rather we don't support builds of llvm with assertions on.

Hey, I'm trying to build zig on Ubuntu. Anyone around?

1508439449
steveno
I followed the instructions on building LLVM, libclang, and liblld from source

1508439475
steveno
the modified the cmake command to use the new compiler and such in ~/local

1508439497
andrewrk
hi steveno

1508439505
andrewrk
there's a much easier way on ubuntu

1508439510
steveno
do tell

1508439511
andrewrk


1508439526
steveno
lulz didn't know about that

1508439560
andrewrk
you want these packages: clang-5.0 libclang-5.0 libclang-5.0-dev llvm-5.0 llvm-5.0-dev liblld-5.0 liblld-5.0-dev cmake

1508439578
andrewrk
and then those instructions from the README should work verbatim

1508439622
steveno
Roger that. Let me try that.

1508440243
steveno
that appears to have worked. Make is no longer exploding.

1508440246
steveno
Thank you!

1508440393
andrewrk
steveno, you're welcome, if you start an open source project in zig link it here and I'll follow along

1508440565
steveno
Roger that.

1508442006
steveno
The "Values" example in the documentation doesn't appear to compile

1508442027
steveno
type 'fn() -> ArgIterator' does not support field access const nullable_value = if (os.args.count() >= 2) os.args.at(1) else null;

1508442283
andrewrk
steveno, you're right, this is out of date. I'll fix this one when I get off work. Here's the issue for adding tests to verify documentation examples:

1508445657
andrewrk
dtzWill, btw did you figure out the commands to get zig building on nixos? -DZIG_EACH_LIB_RPATH=on -DZIG_DYNAMIC_LINKER="$(cc -print-file-name=ld-linux-x86-64.so.2)"

1508445676
andrewrk
the configure parameters, I mean. it works out of the box on nixos, no wrapping/patching needed

1508445887
dtzWill
oh, great! No Ihaven't had a change unfortunately but tyvm
