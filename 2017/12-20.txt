zig/master d686113 Andrew Kelley: fix crash when implicitly casting array of len 0 to slice...

aiwakura
andrewrk I'm gonna work on #438

andrewrk
nice!

aiwakura, I'll be online for about 25 more minutes then I'm headed to bed

1513745696
aiwakura
cool

1513745699
aiwakura
any pointer on where to start?

1513745889

you'll probably want to keep the code in zig_llvm.hpp/cpp which exposes the LLVM enums for targets. But we'll want our own enums in target.hpp on top of that with our own string names

1513745943
andrewrk
and some things you should do with our enums: 1. don't include targets that don't work, shown in that issue. 2. omit darwin; we should use macos and ios instead 3. add zen :D

1513745944
aiwakura
seems straightforward

1513745962
aiwakura
:D

aiwakura, you'll also need to change the generated builtin.zig file in codegen.cpp:define_builtin_compile_vars

1513746003
andrewrk
then just make sure we're generating the correct LLVM IR when we cross compile

1513746014
andrewrk
and at that point I think compile errors should lead you toward the rest of the patch

1513746087
andrewrk
aiwakura, make sure target.cpp:get_target_triple is correct

1513746112
andrewrk
that will be changed with #438

andrewrk: I'm going to try to compile the nrf-demo for nRF52 as well (Cortex M4). I'm having some issue there though.

zig build-obj --target-os freestanding --target-arch thumb --assembly system\gcc_startup_nrf52.S -isystem include --libc-include-dir include test52.zig LLVM ERROR: Unknown Arch: 19

LLVM ERROR: Unknown Arch: 19

That's ".arch armv7e-m" in gcc_startup_nrf52.S it's complaining about

1513769513
skyfex_
.arch armv7-m works though

1513771703
skyfex_
OK, I got Zig to run on NRF52/Cortex-M4 :) There's only that armv7e-m issue so far

skyfex_, thanks for the report

1513783672
andrewrk
I think this is an issue with llvm's assembly parsing

1513783687
andrewrk
we should probably file a bug
