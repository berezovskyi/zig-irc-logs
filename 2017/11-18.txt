andrewrk: I have question about generic functions. Builtins are magic, for example @divExact(T, T) -> T. It doesn't need any ceremony on form of explicit type parameter.

Is there some way to implement user functions in this style? For example sin(f32|f64|f128) -> f32|f64|f128 ? The type of a value which is passed into such function is always known by the compiler, so it seems natural to be able use this information.

PV_: yes, you can set the type to `var`

Then it can be any type

andrewrk: ooh, this allows so many things. Could you add an example?  I got impression that a type parameter is mandatory.
