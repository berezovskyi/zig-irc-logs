puppp: I'll add docs for that tonight and link you to them

I wonder how Rust searches for the msbuild tools

1508727291
andrewrk
dimenus, good point. I never looked that up

1508727313
andrewrk
where do you have msvc installed to?

1508727489
dimenus
nothing funky I spose, just a non-system drive

1508727490
dimenus
E:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.11.25503\lib\x64

1508727971
dimenus
andrewrk, rustup detects it so I'm sure it's in there

1508728022
andrewrk
dimenus, interesting, good to know

1508728030
andrewrk
maybe I'll pop in to the rust-dev irc channel

1508728351
andrewrk
looks like there's a registry key

1508728460
andrewrk


1508728676
dimenus
cool, yeah that definitely has the root tree in my case

1508728910
dimenus
andrewrk: may be worth translating this to Zig:

1508729131
andrewrk
dimenus, yep, good find. I'll do that as part of #539

1508729347
dimenus
that was a bit old. Microsoft published their own native tool, but it looks like quite a bit of code:

achambe
Hi there

1508737722
achambe
andrewrk: I noticed you use nix, what do you have in your configuration.nix to be able to build zig? I'm relatively new to nix, I have clang and cmake, but the libraries are not installed it seems.

1508738387
achambe
another question I have, I seem to have read about a c to zig tool

1508738391
achambe
but can't find the code

1508738398
achambe
am I wrong about that existing?

1508756211
Kiwii_
Hi !

1508766130
andrewrk
hi achamb

1508766178
andrewrk
I have a file ~/env/zig.nix and  when I build zig I create a nix shell like this: nix-shell ~/env/zig.nix

1508766207
andrewrk


1508766242
andrewrk
achamb, try this:  zig parsec --verbose some-file.c

1508766268
andrewrk
it's still under development, but it can understand most prototypes and some source translation

1508766290
andrewrk
here are some examples of what it understands:

1508767525
hasen_judy
I'm trying to build a minimal sdl2 program

1508767565
hasen_judy
The compiler is giving me an error in including SDL2/SDL.h because AvailabilityMacros.h is not found

1508767610
hasen_judy


1508767773
andrewrk
hasen_judy, maybe you need to pass a -isystem argument, or if you are using zig build, addCIncludePath

1508767822
hasen_judy
ok, I'll look into addCIncludePath

1508768053
andrewrk
hasen_judy, hmm I think zig build is missing some API for this

1508768098
hasen_judy
hm, I think I found the path for AvailabilityMacros using the locate command

1508768100
hasen_judy
so I added it

1508768101
hasen_judy
b.addCIncludePath("/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/Kernel.framework/Versions/A/Headers/");

1508768170
hasen_judy
but now it says:

1508768171
hasen_judy
note: 'stdio.h' file not found

1508768199
andrewrk
interesting, we should already have the include path for stdio.h

1508768207
andrewrk
but it might give us a clue to manually add that path too

1508768227
hasen_judy
FWIW I'm trying the barest minimum code

1508768237
andrewrk
yeah I don't think anyone got SDL working out of the box yet

1508768250
hasen_judy
main.zig:

1508768253
andrewrk
maybe we should add the framework paths automatically?

1508768271
hasen_judy
build.zig:

1508768303
hasen_judy
zig version: 0.1.1.c1642355

1508768327
hasen_judy
Earlier today I got the tetris thing working on another mac

1508768342
hasen_judy
so I got surprised with the stdio not found just now

1508768385
andrewrk
hasen_judy, I'll try getting SDL to work on my mac later tonight and iron out the kinks

1508768412
andrewrk
I'm not sure why stdio.h wouldn't be found

1508768418
hasen_judy
anyway, I'm trying to run tetris on this mac as well

1508768427
hasen_judy
installing dependencies from brew

1508768429
hasen_judy
first, libepoxy

1508768680
hasen_judy
hm, still getting errors about things that should be standard, I think

1508768695
andrewrk
hasen_judy, frameworks?

1508768700
hasen_judy


1508768724
hasen_judy
I'm not sure what I have to do to get the right frameworks

1508768733
hasen_judy
never actually worked on a C/C++ project on this machine

1508768739
hasen_judy
although I managed to get the zig compiler to build

1508768747
hasen_judy
so arguably some form of C library is there somewhere

1508768786
andrewrk
I think it's not finding libc headers

1508768789
hasen_judy
trying `xcode-select --install`

1508768794
andrewrk
where is e.g. stdlib.h?

1508768798
hasen_judy
even though I have an impression I did run that a long time ago

1508768930
hasen_judy
hm, appears to be in places like: /usr/local/Cellar/gcc/7.2.0/include/c++/7.2.0/stdlib.h

1508768944
hasen_judy
or /usr/local/Cellar/llvm/5.0.0/include/c++/v1/stdlib.h

1508768986
andrewrk
you should be able to add one of those directories

1508769000
andrewrk
usually you don't have to because zig is configured with the path hard coded

1508769350
hasen_judy
yea I'm not sure what's going on

1508769491
dimenus
andrewrk: do you think it's better to add msvc detection in zig code or in the compiler itself?

1508769550
andrewrk
dimenus, zig compiler should detect msvc

1508769582
hasen_judy
how about this error?

1508769590
hasen_judy
inttypes.h:30:15: note: 'inttypes.h'

1508769598
hasen_judy
^  file not found

1508769615
andrewrk
I think that's the same thing, can't find inttypes.h from libc

1508769667
hasen_judy
ok, I was confused because the file itself is inttypes.hs

1508769671
hasen_judy
the error is in /Users/hasenj/lib/zig/include/inttypes.h

1508769682
hasen_judy
but the line is #include_next (which I've never seen before)

1508769687
andrewrk
hasen_judy, right. clang/zig ship with inttypes.h which include inttypes.h from libc

1508769696
hasen_judy
got it

1508769702
andrewrk
zig is copying clang's behavior here since we use clang to import .h files

1508770066
andrewrk
hasen_judy, ideally you would give zig the path to the libc that was used to compile SDL

1508770072
andrewrk
which looks like it was with homebrew

1508770098
andrewrk
I'm confused why you don't have stdlib.h in /usr/include

1508770116
hasen_judy
for some reason I'm getting ls: /usr/include: No such file or directory

1508770125
andrewrk
that seems very odd

1508770130
hasen_judy
yes

1508770136
hasen_judy
I'll try rebooting - just in case

1508770443
tankfeeder
failed on archlinux

1508770444
tankfeeder


1508770456
tankfeeder
recreate zig pkg

1508770499
tankfeeder
# zig version

1508770499
tankfeeder
0.0.0.4e2a5e6b

1508770505
tankfeeder
^^^ last version.

1508770512
hasen_judy
still not /usr/include

1508770523
hasen_judy
googling a bit, it seems the folder does not exist on mac

1508770542
andrewrk
hasen_judy, which macos version? did you upgrade to high sierra?

1508770563
hasen_judy
I didn't no update, it's just sierra 10.12.5

1508770569
hasen_judy
did not upgrade *

1508770579
andrewrk
that's the same as my macbook

1508770617
dimenus
tankfeeder: your zig version is actually zig version 0.1.1.c1642355

1508770628
andrewrk
tankfeeder, hmm. looks like it needs to -lcurses

1508770629
dimenus
what version of llvm/clang are you using?

1508770683
tankfeeder
dimenus: llvm 5

1508770686
tankfeeder
always worked

1508770709
tankfeeder
tieus did zig-git on archlinux

1508770750
andrewrk
tankfeeder, llvm-config --system-libs

1508770753
andrewrk
does it include -lcurses ?

1508770777
tankfeeder
andrewrk: empty output

1508770793
andrewrk
I think this is a bug in llvm. We can workaround by adding -lcurses in the AUR

1508770801
tankfeeder
yeap

1508770844
tankfeeder
i have to ping tiehuis

1508771105
tankfeeder
tiehuis pinged.

1508771740
achamb
thank you!

1508779138
dimenus
andrewrk: sorry to keep asking about msvc, but are you thinking we'll query the registry or go the full route of rust (COM interface)

1508781626
andrewrk
dimenus, whatever way is the most correct

1508781628
andrewrk
and reliably

1508781631
andrewrk
*reliable

1508782050
dimenus
com is probably the most correct, time to learn com I guess

1508782287
andrewrk
dimenus, godspeed
