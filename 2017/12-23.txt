zig/master 39c7bd2 Andrew Kelley: port most of main.cpp to self hosted compiler

So is it just me, or are both of the Hello World examples in the "documentation" broken?

MajorLag: on Windows i suggest using the most recently successful build from appveyor

I think you're looking at the master branch docs and using release 0.1.1

You can find a link in the readme to appveyor, then look for recent green builds then click "artifacts"

I'm AFK but I can try to help if you run into a problem

Yeah, that seems better. Didn't realize the documentation link from the homepage would match master instead of the 0.1.1 release

The URL has master in it right? You can replace that with 0.1.1 to get the relevant docs

Srsly though this compiler is pretty new and I work on it every day so the master branch is way better than 0.1.1 already

I didn't read the url. I had made the mistaken assumption that 0.1.1, being an announced release, would be considered more "official"

Fair point. Next release I'll make the docs link point to the latest release version
