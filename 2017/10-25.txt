does anyone in here use windows?

1508953724
dimenus
looking to see if you have a registry key that exists at : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Microsoft SDKs\Windows

Dimenus, I'll check on my windows laptop when I get home, but that will be 6+ hours from now

i had a working machine that I broke by deleting keys, but the installer didn't recreate them :(

I'm reaching out to my friend who works at MS to see if he can talk to the Visual Studio team

1508953862
dimenus
but no luck so far

I think Microsoft SDKs is part of windows, not part of MSVC

will save those, this is for kernel32.lib though

1508953986
dimenus
which is in the windows sdk - which is an extra package shipped with each instance of visual studio

1508954002
dimenus
all of this worked for me but I read online about people having issues with the keys not being created

1508954003
andrewrk
this is for finding the folder that contains kernel32.lib?

1508954007
dimenus
so i deleted mine without backing them up

1508954008
dimenus
like an idiot

1508954010
dimenus
correct

1508954026
andrewrk
it's ok Dimenus, the science had to be done

1508954060
andrewrk
btw we generate kernel32.lib if you don't link libc

1508954074
andrewrk
but we do have to know where the system provided kernel32.lib is if the system-provided libc depends on it

1508954097
dimenus
what generates it, llvm?

1508954116
andrewrk
we create a .def file based on the functions we call, then generate it with LLD

1508954156
andrewrk
the reason we need system provided kernel32.lib if you depend on  system libc is we don't know what functions in kernel32 libc calls so we can't generate it

1508954319
dimenus
yeah that makes sense
