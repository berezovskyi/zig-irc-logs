How am I suppose to use open, create() et cetera when they return usize, instead of i32?

wait that looks like libc stuff, these syscalls that sometimes return -1 returning usize is really confusing

scientes, I think you want to use the std.io functions, not the std.os.linux functions

syscalls don't actually return -1, that's libc

oh

syscalls return an isize with the range (-4096,0) representing an error; if there's no error you're supposed to @bitCast to usize

so you can use linux.getErrNo(the_usize) to get the error from a syscall result

depending on what you're trying to do there might already be a higher level cross-platform API for that in the std lib
