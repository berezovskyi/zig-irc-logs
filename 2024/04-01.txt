are there any libraries written for Zig for coroutines yet? or are there some workarounds on importing similar stuff written in C and making it to work under Zig? (since async/await is not par of Zig)

Question for the linkers+loaders experts: Does the presence of `STV_PROTECTED` symbols in a shared object imply using PIE?

Because I was having trouble linking zig on Illumos again since all the libc symbols are marked PROTECTED, but adding `-fPIE` fixed it.

Another question, it seems LLVM defaults to building with -fPIC on if it detects it. Is that the cause of all my issues? Because before I was getting `lld: cannot preempt symbol` for a bunch of libc symbols.
