Iâ€™m blown away by how well done the collection types in std are, like ArrayList and ArrayHashMap, just phenomenal quality

If I iterate over a struct's fields at comptime, is the order of the fields guaranteed?

rockorager: > Type information of structs, unions, enums, and error sets has fields which are guaranteed to be in the same order as appearance in the source file.

thank you bw. I'm also happy with ArrayList and ArrayHashMap. some of the other std lib API, not as much :)

my only minor complaint about ArrayList is that I think Unmanaged should be the default
