Is it possible to have a union like in C? Where I can interpret the same memory in two different ways?

strange thought maybe, you know ruby on rails uses erb (html + ruby), it seems like a person could do something similar but have zig comptime be the templated language?

so zig-on-rails but instead of a gazillion of files/packages you end up with a single binary :-)

well it's nice to not have to recompile after only changing some template files
