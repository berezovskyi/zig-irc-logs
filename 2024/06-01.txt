IntelliJ needs to make IDE for Zig! like Goland ;)

Even as a fan of free software I have to admit IntelliJ makes amazing IDEs. I've done Java/Android development with IDEA/Android Studio for the past five years and it's been a delight. I guess Zig would need to become a bit more popular before they'd set their eyes on it though.

What do most zigsters(?) use, Vim or Emacs?

does someone know a project that is both an executable and a library to take build.zig as example?

gcarlos8: with any recent version of zig, `zig init` will populate pwd with a build.zig w/ exe and static library boiler plate

gcarlos8!~gcarlos@37.218.246.133
freshcoffee: thank you, I was dealing with an outdated boilerplate here

companion_cube: The answer is apparently toyota (corolla)

companion_cube!~simon@user/meow/companion-cube:68572
No, it's the most popular, but not what most people are driving. My point is that there's not necessarily one meaningful answer

companion_cube: Based on sales yeah
