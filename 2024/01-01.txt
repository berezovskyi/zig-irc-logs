Does Zig's build system have something similar to https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/CheckSymbolExists.html ?

fsx, it does not. can you share more about this intriguing use case?

oh, this is for testing the C compiler's capabilities right? Generally, the zig build system way to do that is to infer the answer to such questions based on the target and build configuration, and assume clang C compiler configuration.

in the future, the zig build system may expand scope to also become a system C toolchain driver in which case feature detection like this will become more relevant - although I think it can be still done much more efficiently than how autotools / cmake does it
