Does `zig build-lib` output static libraries with the wrong extension on Windows? I'm not very intimate with linker stuff, but pretty sure MinGW uses unix style libXXX.a for static libraries, while Zig outputs XXX.lib files

Is there a name for an optimization which removes a struct field because it is known to be a copy of another variable in the same scope which is constant? I'm specifically thinking about `std.io.fixedBufferStream` when the buffer is a `[]const u8` variable. As in, the naive layout of that code would use 5 words to express the stream+variable, but it would make sense that only 3 words would be necessary.

Under what conditions should I expect a custom panic function to have a null `error_return_trace` (StackTrace)?

gcoakes: perhaps "scalar replacement of aggregate"
