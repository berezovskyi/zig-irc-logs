coleman, thanks! I got it merged and updated the bindings as well and it looks good from here. when you get a chance to try it out, let me know if you run into any issues

sorry for n00b question, but my google-fu is failing me... trying to gzip-compress from a slice to a slice.  std.compress.gzip expects reader and writer, so i guess the question is how to create a reader / writer which simply read from/to a slice?

ok, looks like i'm looking for std.io.fixedBufferStream as reader and maybe std.ArrayList.writer() as writer

that repo also has a workflow for GitHub to build and deploy them, if you wanted to do something like that too
