coleman, did you see frank's comment on your libsodium discussion? given that, if you want to update your nats.c dependency PR to be against a commit on the libsodium `stable` branch, I'd be happy to merge it as long as it still works with zig 0.13 (I believe it should)

if you don't have time to do it, I'll get around to it... eventually

Just discovered zigbin.io, is the infra built using zig? Is the sources available anywhere?

torque: I'll update it to the stable branch and @ you on the PR. Will your CI's testing cover 0.13? I am using 0.14-dev

Can you use std.ArrayList(u8) as string that can change sizes? neat

I want to write a function that can return a string and I'm not sure how long that string will be. What's the best way to handle that? I'm thinking to just take an allocator then return an ArrayList(u8) that the caller can deinit themselves but is there a better idea?

The_Buhs: I would have the signature: fn foo(writer: std.io.AnyWriter) anyerror!void

The writer could be backed by anything

Quick question here: What are the appropriate functions for "serializing" integers as twos complement?

andrewrk says "it isn't that hard" to use them, any pointer for noobs like me?
