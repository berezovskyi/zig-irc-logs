Hey, can I get some installation help?  I'm trying to get it to work and I don't know what I'm doing wrong.  I stuck it in /usr/lib/zig-linux figuring that would be included in path, then I tried adding that anyway when it still didn't work and now it still doesn't work.

Scary_Guy!~Scary_Guy@user/Scary-Guy:71128
Also, I am a moron so please take that into account

I don't code anything, I'm literally just trying to compile the new ly-dm which seems to use it.

Using Ubuntu but I ripped out the Snap system because I hate it.

Scary_Guy, this? https://github.com/liweitianux/ly-dm

1720582634
braewoods!~braewoods@user/braewoods
Oh. Nevermind, it was a fork.

I was like, I don't see any Zig here.

1720582678
Scary_Guy!~Scary_Guy@user/Scary-Guy:71128
Yeah, I guess it just got updated a week ago after like a year.

1720582712
Scary_Guy!~Scary_Guy@user/Scary-Guy:71128
https://github.com/fairyglade/ly is the main repo for that AFAIK

Scary_Guy, you seen https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/#installing-zig ?

1720582798
Scary_Guy!~Scary_Guy@user/Scary-Guy:71128
I glanced at it.  It works if I cd directly to it in /usr/lib/zig-linux but path doesn't seem to pick it up

1720582851
squeek502!~squeek502@user/squeek502
no need for /usr/lib, just extract it anywhere and add the directory to your PATH environment variable

1720582903
Scary_Guy!~Scary_Guy@user/Scary-Guy:71128
I feel like that's where it should go though.  Keeps my FS tidy.

1720582977
squeek502!~squeek502@user/squeek502
basically, the zig executable needs to be accessible from your PATH (can also be a symlink to the zig executable), and the `lib` directory of zig needs to be next to the zig executable

1720583142
squeek502!~squeek502@user/squeek502
personally i have a symlink at ~/.local/bin/zig that points to the zig executable (which can be installed wherever)

1720583169
Scary_Guy!~Scary_Guy@user/Scary-Guy:71128
Maybe I'll try moving it there

1720583578
Scary_Guy!~Scary_Guy@user/Scary-Guy:71128
Still no luck

I'll keep poking at it I guess.  I'm sure it's just a me thing.  l8r

it always surprises me when someone is fairly deep into linux as a user but somehow doesn't have basic knowledge of things like PATH

1720589219
braewoods!~braewoods@user/braewoods
torque, or how the many random libc functions work. :P

if you're trying to build your own display manager, I feel like that's "fairly deep"

my first experience with linux was as a 14 year old and I started with dwm and I had no idea what I was doing :D

a tidy FS is one that was never mutated by the root user outside of the system package manager

the only people who have different opinions than this are newbies

I can't say I understand why you'd want one though. It's basically a slightly different version of agetty.

1720595809
braewoods!~braewoods@user/braewoods
I assume you'd want a GUI display manager to login to a GUI environment, as you're already going to be using one anyway.

braewoods: I just login from the TTY nowadays, but I used to use a TUI dm (that I can't remember right now) just because it was lightweight and looked nice *shrug*

fengshaun!~fengshaun@d198-166-106-219.abhsia.telus.net
it seems like the else clause in while loop can't have curly braces if you just want to return a however-computed value, right?

1720644797
fengshaun!~fengshaun@d198-166-106-219.abhsia.telus.net
while(cond) { break x; } else { x = do_calc(); break/return/etc x+2; }

1720644887
fengshaun!~fengshaun@d198-166-106-219.abhsia.telus.net
I mean, without using a label

1720644992
rockorager!2bbd732aa1@irc.pico.sh
You can return, but you will need a label for the break

1720645010
fengshaun!~fengshaun@d198-166-106-219.abhsia.telus.net
return would be for the function

1720645014
fengshaun!~fengshaun@d198-166-106-219.abhsia.telus.net
fair enough, makes sense

1720645053
fengshaun!~fengshaun@d198-166-106-219.abhsia.telus.net
`label: while(cond) {break x;} else { break :label y }` looks reasonable enough

kudos to whoever is maintaining ziglings, it's really nice
