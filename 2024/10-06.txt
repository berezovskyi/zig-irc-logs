hi andrewrk, yes, that seems to be the case :) not sure why `zig2 build-exe` died on that, considering it does appear to pass `-lc`..

andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
usually that happens because various C++ source files were compiled with different compilers

1728173254
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
in this case you have the LLVM libraries, libstdc++, and the handful of C++ source files in zig codebase

yeah, i decided to wipe out everything and rebuild from scratch, and i'll see if the issue remains the same

btw, is it possible to choose use shared llvm libraries?

Hi, I wrote some code that uses a val = ?Union{str: []const u8, float: f64}. I am trying to std.testing.expectEqual(null, val) but get unable to compare untagged union values. Is there a way to test that it is set to null?

well, same problem. i tried 8b82a0e0fc5cac9a5376f06955ca4419b9a9923f as well which was the last commit to use llvm 18..

meson seems to give better feedback. It gives the user more info, but more importantly I think I saw some compiler warnings (c code), which I didn't see when working on the zig build

hm, I can't get zls 0.13.0 to care about C include paths added with Module.addIncludePath. Can't find headers in @cInclude no matter what I try, while `zig build` works fine. Is this a known bug?

andrewrk: for c.zig platform defs of `c.T` did you use some trick to expand the values to an int value from system includes or was it good old roll up your sleeves hard work?

hm looking through docs I can't find a way to makePath an absolute path

1728233674
tranzystorekk!86175ff574@voidlinux/maintainer/tranzystorekk
what im trying to do: ensure the entire data dir path for my program exists

1728233698
tranzystorekk!86175ff574@voidlinux/maintainer/tranzystorekk
like /home/foobar/.local/share/myapp

1728233884
tranzystorekk!86175ff574@voidlinux/maintainer/tranzystorekk
and known-folders spits out the whole absolute path

tranzystorekk: have you looked at https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.fs.makeDirAbsolute although you’d have to test if this would do the same as mkdir -p which reading the docs I’m not sure if it would create all or just the final directory.

freshcoffee: that namespace is a bit wonky, I'm not sure it makes sense in its current form

ashie!~ashie@user/ashie
any way to get/set a constant in a build.zig, that I can then access from the code? for example things like version number?
