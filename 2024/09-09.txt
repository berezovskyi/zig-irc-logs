So, I have some questions about graf. I figured I'd ask it here since the lead dev is also a Zig core developer. Is it intended to be a new backend for Zig once LLVM is no longer a dependency?

If that's the case, work probably isn't going to start on it until after #16270, right? Otherwise it's kinda jumping the gun.

what is graf?

ah, found it: https://github.com/vezel-dev/graf

I don't think alexrp frequents the IRC channel, you'd have better luck on zulip

looks like vezel has its own zulip even

that's some neat stuff. Does equality saturation require a ton of memory?

Unclear.

The paper on equality saturation doesn't specify memory consumption at runtime, though the Macbook the authors tested Egg on had 16GB of RAM.

One presumes it isn't awful, though, as the Rust implementation of the algorithm in question has seen some applications (scroll down on https://egraphs-good.github.io/)

Hi, i have trouble understanding float-int conversion. Here is what i'm trying to do: https://dpaste.com/7F8PMPXGD

1725903482
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
Lynix: 10 is an int, change it to 10.0

1725903499
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
you can't multiply a float with an int

1725903538
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
and well, `a` is also an int, so the same thing applies, but you tried a solution for that one

1725903595
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
you can combine your second two attempts for explicit conversion as well, as in: @as(f32, @floatFromInt(a))

1725903600
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
if that helps with other related scenarios

1725903644
Lynix!~raphael@77.64.254.206
bblack: that worked 

1725903675
Lynix!~raphael@77.64.254.206
is this always required when casting an int to a float? 

1725903735
Lynix!~raphael@77.64.254.206
Gliptic: The 10 seems to get implicitly casted to a float. It works without 10.0 

1725903780
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
hm, probably mixing up my languages

1725903783
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
as the error said, @floatFromInt() needs to know what exact kind of float it's converting to, which it gets from context

1725903804
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
if you had been passing "a" to a function, and the function's argument was specified as "f32", then that would've been enough context, for example.

1725903817
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
but in this math expression's context, you have to be explicit

1725903959
Lynix!~raphael@77.64.254.206
good to know. Seems more explicit but also makes math very verbose. I will see what that means in practice. Thanks for the help 

1725904017
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
yeah it is often more-verbose.  But after coming from the pain of trying to deal with all the implicit conversions in the C world, I much prefer the explicit-ness :)

just today I learned that async() is on halt

1725908474
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
yes that feature is awaiting some other priorities to be completed

jemius!~imperator@200116b82dbb38009738d0ee7e98b9a2.dip.versatel-1u1.de
It seems quite a complicated feature for a slim language anyways IMO

torque!~tachyon@user/torque
async is the feature that originally got me interested in zig and let me tell you if youve ever tried to write callback-based asynchronous code in C, it is impossible not to make spaghetti

1725917966
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
still holding out hope that some first-class functionality of that sort makes it in
