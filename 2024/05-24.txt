you could probably add some subliminal messages in there like "donate to zig today" :P

(I don't want to bother anyone, especially given that I am not (yet) a zig user. I know that goto has been removed, but it means that translating code that uses it (like the code generated by bison) generate an error. As far as I know there is no port of bison to zig (yet) so it's not like if there was an option to use a different tools. Sorry for

you can use labeled break to jump down and loops to jump up

I tried multiple ways to unwrap the {.manager} optional pointer, or compare it against null and only if not null attempt to print manager's name etc but I run into one error after another; what's the cleanest way to achieve what I want to do here?

1716535909
src!~src@user/src
(print the Manager line only if the pointer's valid / not null)

1716535941
src!~src@user/src
(or print "None" as manager if the pointer's null)

`.?` to unwrap and `.` for field access, not sure why this has eluded me

1716541816
slowjo!~slowjo@sourcehut/user/slowjo
src: you should also be able to use a capture to not go through the `.?` which is just sugar for `orelse unreachable`

is there a gnu readline type zig standard lib type function(s) available today?

aquamo4k: no. what is your use case?

just wanted an easy in app prompt with emacs editing built in to run a text based menu system

You might try this: https://github.com/rockorager/libvaxis

Let me throw together a quick readline example for you

aquamo4k: Not sure if it would work for your use-case but the readline CLI tool can be used to "wrap" another CLI tool that doesn't have readline capabilities built-in.

huh. I'm observing a read() syscall on the read end of a pipe with O_NONBLOCK cause 100% cpu usage and never return from read()

andrewrk: yeah, I hate zig's stdlib retries 

1716569943
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
might be totally different, but I had that same symptom in my shell that had me reimplement read() so I could control the behavior on read errors

1716569945
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
oh, I'm an idiot. I'm looping forever because 0 bytes were read

Pretty sure once this lands https://github.com/ziglang/zig/projects/6  I'll probably go from "Go" to "zig" unless there is a really good reason not to
