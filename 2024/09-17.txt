Ran across the issue about the fuzzer outputting a jingle :). Love it.

No it's an open issue.

Personally I think a little laser zap sound would be pretty straightforward and thematically appropriate.

But I love the idea of the sound being in some manner based on the bytes used to find the bug.

just send the bytes directly to the audio and ear r*pe the user

Wouldn't exactly feel celebratory... and I don't think anyone wants dialup flashbacks.

Fiddling with how I want to set up the perf bench site. Been investigating if I could do the whole shebang in Zig but it's frankly a poor fit. Will probably just use Bun so at least it's still _technically_ powered by Zig :)

I know a js dev who uses bun who will be very happy to hear that

Bun's a nice little project.

Still after a decade of JS dev honestly my preference is for as little explicit JS as possible. HTMX is lovely. I hand write CSS.

Problem with all the fancy UI kits is they don't adhere to good principles of progressive enhancement or graceful degradation. Polyfills are an afterthought.

 JavaScript build system nonsense just hurts the soul. Minification is obfuscation. Just write less code and skip minifying it, leave the comments in. ðŸ™ˆ

When you save 20kb in framework overhead you can afford a few b of helpful comments for whomever might want to hack on your code :)

yeah its kinda interesting that javascript, which delivers the source to you on every website, is not closer to being open source or easily modifiable than any other unity game

1726540630

minification makes me sad

could someone explain what /home/scott/.cache/zig/p/.../libdawn.a' is neither ET_REL nor LLVM bitcode means? Is it that the libdawn dependency im pulling is just borked or am I using zig build wrong?
