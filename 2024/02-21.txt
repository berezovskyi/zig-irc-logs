without the www. it seems to work for me

1708474897
daurnimator!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
did something change?

1708474919
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
no, there was never anything at the www subdomain

1708474930
daurnimator!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
then how did it work for you? :/

1708474931
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
you changed your dns provider maybe? I know some super shady dns hosts will populate www "for you"

1708474981
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
it worked for me because I didn't click your link, I just went to https://ziglang.org/ not noticing the www  

1708487573
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
Making `www.` work is simply a matter of just assigning a CNAME record, which used to be common knowledge 2 decades ago, but not anymore these days. So now you've got lots of "modern" websites that either will work without and not with, or work with and not without.

1708487596
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
Or the one will redirect to the other.

1708487831
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
why would I want www.ziglang.org to also work? then there would be a redundant way to make URLs

1708487858
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
www.ziglang does resolve for me

1708487894
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
Dunno, I'm personally perfectly fine without "www.". I just say this because it's an observation I've made for a long time.

1708487924
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
drill www.ziglang.org [...] ;; flags: qr rd ra ; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 8, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0 [...] ;; ANSWER SECTION: www.ziglang.org. 5 IN A 16.182.32.109

1708487966
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
And it actually won't be redundant. Simply having a CNAME for "www." assigned to "ziglang.org" will simply automatically point all links with "www." links to links without one.

1708488021
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
Fuck, let me rephrase.

1708488041
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
And it actually won't be redundant. Simply having a CNAME for "www." assigned to "ziglang.org" will automatically point all links with "www." to those without one.

Yes it does.

Done it myself for decades even.

1708488180
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
not if you use the word links... you'd still need webserver, and SSL support

1708488248
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
No need to add webserver support with a CNAME record, only with an A or AAAA record. As for SSL support: `certbot certonly -d ziglang.org -d www.ziglang.org`.

1708488250
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
but more to the point that already exists as long as you don't use https https://gist.github.com/GrayHatter/8af942d4390ee91458193c876730b5ab

1708488292

remiliascarlet: ziglang is hosted on AWS, and the cert is verified by them as well

1708488314
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
Never used AWS before, so no idea how they handle it.

1708488375
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
right... the answer seems to be "poorly" because `curl https://www.ziglang.org` fails, while `curl http://www.ziglang.org` will give you a 301

1708488392
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
which is somewhat disapointing

1708488436
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
But then again, I've done web development way before it became an absolute disaster.

1708488936
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
colo?

1708488951
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
rent a whole server, use it for ziglang.org and for file storage, maybe even some more stuff like automated perf testing

1708488965
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
Getting off somebody elses computer is generally always a good idea.

1708489047
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
VPS's are crazy cheap these days compared to back in the old days, or even hosting from home can be done easily if you have a good enough internet connection and a static IP.

1708489053
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
we already have a few rented servers being used for CI but they're considered compromised so they can't be used to host ziglang.org

1708489156
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
andrewrk: unless you control the DC, I'd consider it compromised

1708489213
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
that seems like an unrealistic threat model

1708489220
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I'll easily admit, that's probably an overly paranoid take. But both VPS, bare metal, and colo all have the same risks

1708489228
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
lol, you're not wrong

1708489253
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
There's no way to have no risks at all.

1708489298
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
Well, there is a way, which involves locking yourself up in a padded room with no object in them at all for the rest of your life.

1708489301
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
the problem with that way of thinking is that it prevents you from taking seriously more realistic threats

1708489314
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
andrewrk: is there a reason you're considering renting bare metal over VPS?

1708489333
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
yes, to have a quiet machine for doing automated perf testing

1708489353
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
ahh, yeah, that'll do it

1708489385
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
also VPS tend to have expensive disk storage while bare metal gives you a big ass SSD

1708489426
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
One thing to be aware of is to make sure it's actually bare metal.

1708489461
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
Very often they'll offer "bare metal" for a cheaper price, which in reality is just a VPS with a much bigger SSD.

lmao... is there anyone on linkedin named howard that says they work for ziglang?

1708490388

Howard can't check his email right now because he doesn't exist. What a pity

1708490410
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
Probably just a phishing email.

1708490427

I was just thinking... I feel bad for anyone named howard that's hired by ziglang in the future

1708490441

he doesn't exist... yet!

<grayhatter> same, do is hosting my mailser... my everything :D

1708490952
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
how are you hosting a mailserver on do, my understanding is that they completely block outbound port 25 on all their vps's now

1708490971
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I haven't noticed anything like that

1708491000
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
Had this a couple years ago when somebody who got mad at me reported me to the web host to take me down, got even more mad that nothing happened. So when he complained about it on social media, I told him that I am the webhost, and I didn't violate any of the terms, and therefore no action will be taken against myself.

1708491031
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
oh, my mistake, they do seem to be filtering 25 but I'm using smtps on 465

1708491051
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
it's not inbound it's outbound port, so you can't send email

1708491095
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
got an email address?

1708491134
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
looking at their support it seems like old accounts may be grandfathered in

1708491170
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
mines not old, but I don't send a lot of email, and the last one I sent did work so... I don't know

1708491342
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
I'm not an expert, maybe most mailservers also listen on an alternate port for incoming mail

1708491434
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
465 for smtps assumedly 

1708491516
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
yeah, that makes sense

1708491750
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
I guess using SSL while you're spamming is too advanced? doesn't really make sense to me to block one port but not the other if your purpose is ostensibly to stop spammers

1708491762
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
I guess the encryption overhead acts as a form of rate limiting, maybe

1708491847
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
much harder to do on a compromised box that's not already running an SMTP daemon

1708491923
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
I suppose that's sort of true

1708491996
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
sort of is being generous... I agree with you, it doesn't make much sense to me either

fengshaun!~fengshaun@d75-155-79-139.abhsia.telus.net
leeward, gtk; if you can get qt-qml running let me know; IUP is one of the most promising ones for native look; if you're ok with a bit more cpu usage (I wasn't) then raylib+raygui or nuklear (both immediate-mode)

1708511319
fengshaun!~fengshaun@d75-155-79-139.abhsia.telus.net

1708523657
leeward!~sask@cust-95-128-93-211.breedbanddelft.nl
The whole single-header library thing is...not my cup of tea. I'd rather eat some CPU cycles than roll my own for this, though. It's just a thin layer to control a server that's written in Zig. Maybe I'll do it in Python or something.

1708534636
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
Last time I was speaking of GUI frameworks, I mentioned Raylib and Nuklear, but neither felt right. So my opinion still remains unaltered from what it was back in 2006: GTK2 is/was the only good GUI framework.

1708534709
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
The best out of those that aren't abandoned is ncurses, but that's not a GUI library, but a TUI one.

1708540264

mmzero!~mega4453@186.14.77.25
Hello! Quick question. I am a bit stumped when it comes to choosing a compiler for Zig. Some recommend to use stable and others to go for nightlies. Is it better to have one over the other or keep both? 

1708543145
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I try very hard to stick to stable if I think other people might want to compile my code. But I'm currently using nightly because I wanted a stdlib function that doesn't exist in v0.11. So it really comes down to what you care about more. Either decision is fine

1708543198
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
moving backwards from master -> v0.11 is likely to be harder, or more complicated than moving forward, so if you really don't know which you'd rather use, I'd start with v0.11 and then move to master only when you find there's something you're missing out on

1708543393
mmzero!~mega4453@186.14.77.25
Thanks! I'll try and stick with stable then, as much as possible at least 

1708543424
txdv!~bentkus@78-56-38-107.static.zebra.lt
yeah, i'd say go for stable until you feel the need for nightly because of a feature or something

1708543789
mmzero!~mega4453@186.14.77.25
Is the self-hosted compiler a 0.12 feature? That's the one that has caught most of my attention 

1708544533
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
IIRC I think it's been self hosted for a while... if you build from source using the guide on the wiki you'll bootstrap the enviroment needed to get a working zig compiler. So first you'll build a zig compiler written in... (wasm I think?) and then using that compiler, you'll build the self hosted compiler giving you a zig complier written in zig, compliled by zig.

1708544554
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
probably a good idea to wait on someone smarter than me to confirm though ;)

1708547905
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
mmzero, normally I would suggest to stick with the most recent stable release but 0.12.0 release is just around the corner so I would suggest instead to use the master branch release until it comes out, then pin at 0.12 

1708548213
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
andrewrk: do you have an 0.12 estimate? I saw feb 26 in the github milestone but that seems very soon...

1708548239

I havent upgraded river to zig master branch yet to check for regressions

1708548282
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
ifreund, I wanted to make it feb 26 but I have been completely sidetracked by all the horrors I saw in std.http when I peeked inside

1708548304
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
so I think I will declare release bankruptcy and give myself another 1-2 weeks

1708548322

1708549303

nothing major, just the last zig upgrade was stopped by https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/19026 , which jacobly0 fixed on the same day! I will cut a new release tomorrow and ask all hermetic_cc_toolchain users to test it promptly

1708549334
