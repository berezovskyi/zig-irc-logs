reminds me of running jokes about a "yet another" ringbuffer implementation in Linux kernel, as is sometimes mentioned in lwn

andrewrk: I still think we should drop the buffered reader API and just have fifo for most cases. It's a superset at the cost of one additional usize.

Just tried to find out on how to get current year, month, day in local timezone...std.time seems to only provide timestamps...std.time.epoch defines types for years, months etc but I don't find a function calculating that from the timestamp!? Do I miss something?

there is fmt.formatDuration() which is marked "pub" in master documentation but the compiler moans about it not beeing pub...and it returns a formatter for formatting a []u8 of course...but I need an u16 with the current year

ah...because there is a second function which is not pub....but again...that is all about creating []u8

a https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c port to zig could be pretty fun
