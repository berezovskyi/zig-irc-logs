hey, does anyone know why I can't build this C hello world anymore with zig v0.13.0?

Honestly I'd just as well revert to v0.12, since it built C fine and zls expects that version anyway, but ziglings expects v0.13 :/

there is no v0.13 release, the latest release of zig is 0.12.0

"Async function pointers preventing the stack size from being known" <- i guess thats the biggest reason not to continue async/await in Zig, since zen of Zig says everything should be clear and transparent. so if one needs coroutines he goes with his own stacked implementation (perhaps adding such thing as std lib). so... is there final decision officially out yet on stopping async/await support? or
