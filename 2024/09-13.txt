andrewrk: great news on the website front! fwiw, I've been eating githubs resources to host zig tarballs for my CI: https://github.com/ifreund/zig-tarball-mirror

why does this work: if (command) |_| {} else return MessageError;

1726246029
gluon!~gluon@2a01:4f8:c0c:e2da::1
but this doesn't: if (!command) |_| return MessageError;

gluon!~gluon@2a01:4f8:c0c:e2da::1
command is ?[]const u8

! is negation, so it applies only to a bool, where if can apply to a bool, or to a "success" type, e.g. bool, null, error

grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
if (command == null) return MessageError

another way to understand it is |_| allows the if statement to "extract" the value from the union, `?[]const u8` or `![]const u8` is `null or []const u8` and `error or []const u8` what should zig do with `!null` or `not null`? the value of `not null` is neither true, nor false

oh i thought that the payload extraction transformed the optional into a boolean

if (command == null) return MessageError <- this was my second attempt, but does not work either.

oh nvm, it does, my test wasn't testing it right

https://zigbin.io/114b8e I have this partly thanks to novakane's zig-fcft-example but line 22 never gets freed. Since zig-fcft-example uses an arena allocator, that's not a problem, but I'm using the C allocator. What's the best way to handle this? Do I just defer a loop to iterate through and free everything in the list or something else?

I just ended up making an arena allocator in that function just for the ArrayList and its members ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
