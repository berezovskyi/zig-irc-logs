Hello all -- what's the current status on package management? Learning the language and I can't find any clear current docs to reference on this. I am aware that .zon files exist but not the correct way to get/use them for projects I want to depend on

1714625784
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
smlavine: status: working fairly well for shallow dependency trees. documentation is available only in the form of API reference and examples 

1714625973
smlavine!~smlavine@sourcehut/user/smlavine
Thanks -- Is there a central repository a la crates.io to find files? Or is up to me to find a URL to `zig fetch` from?

1714626190
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
zig package management is decentralized

1714626220
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
most software repository websites have URLs that can be used to fetch from

1714626245
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
here are some examples using github URLs: https://codeberg.org/andrewrk/player/src/branch/main/build.zig.zon

1714626322
smlavine!~smlavine@sourcehut/user/smlavine
Ah, so it can just pull any release tarball. That's neat. Thanks for the help!

1714626359
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
no problem. happy to provide more build system examples as needed

1714626436
smlavine!~smlavine@sourcehut/user/smlavine
:)  I appreciate all the work that has gone into bringing a C project "into the fold" piece by piece. Makes it very easy to do while also getting the hang of the language

1714627246

1714628136
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
ha you're actually trying to run the software eh?

1714628140
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
it's not good yet

1714628163
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
lol, my standard for good is pretty low

1714628197
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
but I'd love to be able to eventually expose a web api for music I play locally, would be a cool thing for streaming 

1714628229
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
I'm hoping to have this be fairly usable within the next few months

1714628289
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
if nothing else, it's already a fun thing to hack on (I've been needing a break from trying to implement TLS1.2 lol)

1714628306
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
the previous version already worked pretty well, although it was a pain in the ass to install (node.js + native C library node module addons) 

1714628326
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
oh, are you clickingbuttons?

1714628346
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
the user? or the activity?

1714628351
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
funny

1714628371
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
oh, no, I don't like the PR

1714628374
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
I feel like I just fell for a supdog joke

1714628475
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I'm not the author for #19308, took me a good minute to figure out you meant the user, and not if you click too many buttons in the webui, the server crashes

1714628520
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
and not that you meant "clicking the buttons" in the web ui, which was a funny bug to find heh

1714631136
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
lol

1714634875
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
last one, promise, I'll create a codeberg account and make a PR like a normal person for the next one lol https://srctree.gr.ht/repo/player.git/commit/537cbc51

1714634995
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
oh I have a plan for that, there's already logic for scanning songs ahead of time to learn perfect duration that ignores their tags

1714634998
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
hmm I suppose I should make a channel for this project

ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
hmm, is there a way to access the version field in my build.zig.zon from my build.zig?

1714640013
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
doesn't seem like it

1714665202
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
lol

1714665511
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I was sure I'd fixed that... but it was self inflicted https://srctree.gr.ht/repo/srctree/commit/50b32f22 guess it's time to start paying bug bounties... that's what I get for needing to invent everything myself, and then not migrating everything over all at once when I expanded the templating engine, and the type system

1714676275
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
ifreund: it's not implemented yet, but you should be able to do `@import("build.zig.zon").version`

I like the fact that it's not rushing for some fixed 1.0 deadline.  Get there when the progress feels ready for it, spend time fixing design issues while you can :)

1714681376
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
every release it becomes more practical to pin to

1714681392
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
0.12.0 is a good one to stick with until the next release

1714681982
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
I'll be streaming some zig development imminently at https://www.twitch.tv/andrewrok/

1714683510
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
andrewrk: nice, I assumed it was planned eventually but just not implemented yet, that seems like a great way to achieve it :)

1714684603
lf94!~lf94@user/lf94
The question has no intention on a fixed timeline. :)

1714684624
lf94!~lf94@user/lf94
Are we 1 to 2 years away? 2 to 4 years?

1714684673
lf94!~lf94@user/lf94
(I know the 0.x.y version is not an indication of how close or far we are to 1.0.0.)

1714684692
lf94!~lf94@user/lf94
(We very well may be extremely close to 1.0.0 when we reach 0.16.0)

1714684906
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
out of those two options I would guess 2-4, its hard to say though and depends on a lot of factors

1714685630
smlavine!~smlavine@sourcehut/user/smlavine
Roll over at 0.99

1714685793
lf94!~lf94@user/lf94
andrewrk: what's your take? "It's done when it's done" surely. Or maybe you have a vague timeline you don't want to disclose? 

1714686773
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
lf94: what's so important with version 1.0?

1714686806
lf94!~lf94@user/lf94
That's when it's stable

1714686830
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
so if v0.20 promised a stable API, would that be ok?

1714687707
lf94!~lf94@user/lf94
I think that'd be fair to say it'd be ok, yep

1714687726
lf94!~lf94@user/lf94
I would imagine if that were said, a LOT of people would deem 0.20 to be a "pseudo 1.0"

1714687762
lf94!~lf94@user/lf94
and then in 50 years, everyone wants to target Zig 0.20, like how a lot of people like targetting C89 

1714690093
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
I have found that writing code for zig 0.11.0 is a perfectly stable target

1714690110
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
of course I vendor all of my dependencies so I don't have to worry about people pulling the rug out from under me

1714690228
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
it just depends on what you're trying to get out of "stability"

1714693070
sg94!~sg94@syn-065-031-150-091.res.spectrum.com
i didn't have a ton of issues keeping up with master (outside of the build api changing violently) 

1714693073
sg94!~sg94@syn-065-031-150-091.res.spectrum.com
but i was mostly just tinkering with zig-gamedev which keeps up to date
