hmm, zig doesn't have an acos implementation for anything other than f32 and f64? is that because we don't want to use the llvm intrinsic, since it will need to be implemented in zig eventually anyway?

it's probably because the existing implementation is just ported from musl and nobody has taken ownership of it or had a need to improve it. naively, since I don't know anything about the codegen backends, I would say it probably makes sense for the inverse trigonometric functions to also have builtins like their normal counterparts do... though I don't know how common a hardware instruction for

Silly question for 0.12: what’s the proper return type magical incantation for a C calling conv method returning a (statically constant, literal) “string” these days?

Without having to specify the length in the type I should add.

e.g. for something like `export fn msg() ??? { return “hello world”; }`

I can of course put in `*const [11:0]u8` and that’ll work but I’d expect there’s some form that doesn’t involve hard-coding the length into the type that ought to work here given it’s null-sentinel anyways...

Ah, should it just be `[*:0]const u8`?
