Hi everyone, is it allowed to paste code here (using zigbin or something) ?

I have an issue with dropping privilege, even when I successfully change the uid/euid and gid/egid I still can access a file that only root has access to

this is the code: https://zigbin.io/5b5a1b

azval: the file permissions (e.g. 644) may still give it access to anyone. Have you tried to strace the binary?

Pistahh: I will try strace, but the file permission is 660 root:root, so only root should be able to access it right ? At least nobody shouldnt be able to do it

azval, I wonder if the file is truly getting closed? Open file descriptors will remain accessible even after dropping root privileges until it is truly closed.

braewoods: in that example it was opened after dropping the privs so it doesn't matter :)

Pistahh, well, I've known enough "smart" implementations that it was just a thought.

even when I force the closing file and use debug build to avoid optimisation, it doesnt seem to change, can still open the file after dropping privileges

newbie zig here: when i compile a zig file, i see some compilation messages, like LLVM Objects and such; is there a flag to quiet it?

Not sure if a flag, but 2>/dev/null should do it
