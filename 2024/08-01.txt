hello. I'm trying to make this package (https://github.com/adamserafini/zaml) work with zig 0.13.0. the issue I'm hitting currently is related to @fieldParentPtr (https://github.com/adamserafini/zaml/blob/eef4558e6c66037e2006f185bb6e3b322e0ac7fb/benchmark/libs/zig-yaml/src/parse.zig#L37).

I'm new to Zig, but as far as I understand, @fieldParentPtr gives you a struct based on a field name and a field pointer. it's not clear to me how I would "rephrase" the code above

elbear: Remove the first argument, the type is now inferred

Ayo: that easy. thanks!

seems there's some ambiguity, because I'm getting error: @fieldParentPtr must have a known result type

elbear!~lucian@86.123.19.204
the issue occurs on line 42, where there is a mapping. I think I need to specify explicitly which of the Node-specific structs to use

1722498246
elbear!~lucian@86.123.19.204
do I do something like `self.Node.Doc`?

Ayo!~Ayo@45.142.232.203
ambiguity can always be resolved by wrapping the @fieldParentPtr inside an @as(T, ..)

having deinit() clean up the parent node feels pretty ugly though, but then I don't know the wider context

elbear!~lucian@86.123.19.204
Ayo: that did it. and yeah, I know what you mean. this code defines a Node struct and inside it more specialized structs: Doc, List, Map, Value. something feels off, but I don't know enough Zig yet to refactor. for now I just want to make this work

I accidentally installed the wrong CPU type of zig compiler on a windows machine and got a weird error message https://dpaste.org/19UBS/raw from it when trying to build a hello world C program. I realized the mistake now, installed zig-windows-x86_64-0.13.0, and building the C program with that works fine, but I wish the error message for what I

wib_jonas!~wib_jonas@business-37-191-60-209.business.broadband.hu
tried earlier gave a clearer hint for what's wrong.

Also I'd like to ask, where's the documentation that tells about all the commands and options that I can give to the zig compiler, such as the build-exe command and the --library option?

wib_jonas, x86-windows being broken is a known bug: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/20047

1722507828
squeek502!~squeek502@user/squeek502
and you can do zig build-exe --help to get information about that command
