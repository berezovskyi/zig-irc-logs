grayhatter: sounds like std.http.Client.fetch

IIRC fetch didn't work for me, and I had to use the more complex API... I don't remember why exactly so let me try again, sounds like I'm forgetting something

oh

fetch doesn't return the body

Hey, is anyone aware of any Linux distro that ships multiple versions of Zig?

sentry: nope, I'd recommend using the statically linked binaries from the zig website if you need multiple versions

1715446089
sentry!~snetry@87.122.231.131
thats annoying, cause Zig is currently stuck to 0.11 on Fedora because of River

1715446115
sentry!~snetry@87.122.231.131
I know that its possible to ship multiple versions of Zig by abusing how Zig looks for its lib folder, but its far from clean

ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
I'll probably do a zig 0.12 compatible river release this week or next fwiw

1715446147
sentry!~snetry@87.122.231.131
aight, good to know

1715446161
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
if fedora wants to patch river, see the next-zig branch (not officially supported)

1715446291
sentry!~snetry@87.122.231.131
eh, I'd rather not

sentry!~snetry@87.122.231.131
waiting a few weeks won't kill me and I still remember trying to patch Zig to a newer LLVM from a horrifcly disjointed branch

wish zigup respected xdg more

1715448421
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
tranzystorekk: While I agree, keep in mind that xdg (basedir) doesn't cover usecases like this. Although it has become somewhat de facto that .local/bin exists and .local/lib, etc. as defined by systemd's own file-heirarchy.7 document

1715448451
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
(I wish XDG people saw the symmetry with /usr/local and just replicated the FHS under .local instead of what they did, but that's too late now)

Honestly, just want it to not plop ~/zig/ right there.

Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
It seems to be fairly alpha stuff, maybe help implement that env var so you can set it to something else until better approaches are found

Actually, to be fair, don't think I've updated zigup in a year or two. Tho, dunno if I've missed any new features from a tool that simple.

Does anyone have a functioning implementation of coroutines in Zig? I almost have one written in inline asm for x86_64 but it keeps segfaulting for odd reasons.

nvm I'm stupid. The stack wasn't aligned. I wasted almost two days on this. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

I was thinking about doing a quick 0.13.0 / 0.12.1 release with not a lot of fanfare, mainly due to the llvm 18 upgrade

1715465493
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
that would be just after llvm tags 18.1.6, the final 18.x release

Gentoo can use multiple versions of zig
