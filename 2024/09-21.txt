I wonder why is ziglang.org not compressing svg files, is the nginx configuration available openly somewhere, where it could maybe accepting PRs?

i have a multiple producer, single consumer setup, where producer threads append values to an ArrayList and the consumer thread pops values from that ArrayList. i'm protecting both operations with mutex locks but i wonder if there's a better way? some other data structure more suited for this than the ArrayList?

gluon: FIFO or LIFO?

1726925413
rockorager!~rockorage@172-234-192-125.ip.linodeusercontent.com
if FIFO is think a ring buffer would be better so you donâ€™t have to move all the items each pop

1726925450
gluon!~gluon@2a01:4f8:c0c:e2da::1
FIFO ideally

1726925454
gluon!~gluon@2a01:4f8:c0c:e2da::1
yeah, thanks

can I disable usage of control characters when running zig build?   i want to run it in scripts and keep log.   I was looking for some option to switch this but `zig --help` is not helpful and `zig build --help` is not it, either

1726934322
netvor_!~netvor@2a00:ca8:a1f:cd0:8ba1:f045:b9f7:fa14
it also does not seem to auto-detect non-interactive mode (ie. `zig build install | cat` will still use control chars)

1726934483
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
it should autodetect non-interactive usage

1726934495
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
if it doesnt thats a bug imo

(it's 0.13.0 btw)

1726934593
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
I tested `zig build 2> foo.txt` and that turns off the control characters at least

1726934598
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
(also 0.13.0)

1726934601
netvor_!~netvor@2a00:ca8:a1f:cd0:8ba1:f045:b9f7:fa14
ah

1726934631
netvor_!~netvor@2a00:ca8:a1f:cd0:8ba1:f045:b9f7:fa14
my bad, I did not realize it's using 2 (which is RARE correct thing to do :D)

1726934650
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
ah yeah

1726934912
netvor!~netvor@2a00:ca8:a1f:cd0:8ba1:f045:b9f7:fa14
ok so it does not use control chars but does not print anything at all..  `zig build install 2>2` (2 is empty)

1726935025
netvor!~netvor@2a00:ca8:a1f:cd0:8ba1:f045:b9f7:fa14
i think it would still be nice to have a way to enforce plain text anyway using cli option or envvar, so that i can still have the log on-the-fly

1726935055
netvor!~netvor@2a00:ca8:a1f:cd0:8ba1:f045:b9f7:fa14
(one can do that using awkward bash syntax i guess)

1726935081
netvor!~netvor@2a00:ca8:a1f:cd0:8ba1:f045:b9f7:fa14
i suppose it would be minor issue, more like ux polishing

netvor: iirc there was a bunch of changes not too long ago around respecting `NOCOLOR` and `YESCOLOR` env vars, idk if that disables anything more than color control chars though

1726937542
netvor!~netvor@2a00:ca8:a1f:cd0:8ba1:f045:b9f7:fa14
tried NOCOLOR=true and NO_COLOR=true and neither has any effect

1726937655
rockorager!~rockorage@172-234-192-125.ip.linodeusercontent.com
No color only turns off color

1726937676
netvor!~netvor@2a00:ca8:a1f:cd0:8ba1:f045:b9f7:fa14
(imho most of these "standards" are kinda misguided; trying to cram what is 3-state problem into 2 states, failing, so inventing a 4 state solutuion)

1726937687
netvor!~netvor@2a00:ca8:a1f:cd0:8ba1:f045:b9f7:fa14
well that's what i would expect from the name

torque!~tachyon@user/torque
if you include `--summary all` it will print out a build summary at the end. this does not give you live progress, however

1726938839
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
or, more accurately, it does not change how the live progress is presented

1726939354
netvor!~netvor@2a00:ca8:a1f:cd0:8ba1:f045:b9f7:fa14
ah, i see now that i haven't been able to access the `zig build --help` because it fails outside of initiated project (and i wrongly assumed this just means that it just does not have any options)

1726939470
netvor!~netvor@2a00:ca8:a1f:cd0:8ba1:f045:b9f7:fa14
so --color off disables all output for me :)  (and 'on' does not actually give colored build, but does do ansi shenanigans which i don't want in log)

1726939593
netvor!~netvor@2a00:ca8:a1f:cd0:8ba1:f045:b9f7:fa14
`--color off --verbose --summary all` seems like a nice compromise (to have at least something iont he log)

1726940029
netvor!~netvor@2a00:ca8:a1f:cd0:8ba1:f045:b9f7:fa14
actually `--color off` is not needed because the auto-detection seems to work after all, it's just that it also disables all output for my project.  (originally i was not seeing output in my logs and assumed the ansi was removed in post which was wrong -- and a questionable assumption)

gluon!~gluon@2a01:4f8:c0c:e2da::1
what could it mean if my zig program keeps a fixed very small resident memory, but virtual memory keeps increasing?

1726945542
gluon!~gluon@2a01:4f8:c0c:e2da::1
probably unused allocations
