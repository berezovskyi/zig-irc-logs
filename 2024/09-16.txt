does anyone here use nix? Im having this problem where cimport.zig isnt found when I try to compile some code that uses cimport

I have a question about the C backend: which C standard does it emit? Is it configurable?

Is there something like addCXXFlags nowadays in build.zig in 0.13 ?

all I want is to parse the C headers of llvm-c and to be able to iterate in code over the definitions, I figured ill just include it with zig and use zigs reflection to do it

I shouldn't need it, I am doing probably something wrong

are you trying to use translate-c? that feature only supports C, not C++
