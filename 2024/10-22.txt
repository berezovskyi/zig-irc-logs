is there a way to "catch" attempts to reach branches marked unreachable for the sake of testing?

dmoerner: you've just asked a question that's peak Zig

1729612429
dmoerner!~dmoerner@fedora/dmoerner
good?

use `comptime unreachable;` and Zig will fail to compile if the compiler thinks that branch is possible

dmoerner: IMHO, very good. I think this is one of the coolest features of zig

dmoerner: if it's every possible to reach an unreachable branch under any circumstances that's a bug in your code

(to actually answer your question)

a related question would be how to test a panic, for that see: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1356

ifreund: to be fair, I could come up with a contrived example where it's possible without a bug in the code (external memory corruption)

1729612873
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
grayhatter: you mean you trust some extern function to return vaild data and it doesn't?

1729612916
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
that sounds like a bug to me... though maybe one that's best fixed by patching whatever is on the other side of the ABI

ifreund: the super contrived example I was thinking of (in part for it's humor) bit flips from cosmic rays without ECC memory

thank you for the link on the panics as well

grayhatter: zig's memory model/abstract machine doesn't include random memory corruption caused by cosmic rays :P

does it include xkcd 378? https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/real_programmers.png

just finished ziglings, which is nice

I got excited when there were async exercises to do, but then they were all skipped :'(
