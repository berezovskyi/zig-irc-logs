did the stdlib TLS implementation see a regression?

IIRC it didn't work on github, but did work on srctree, but now it fails to fetch from srctree, but does work on github

no known regressions, please file a bug if you have one to report

just tested on 0.13-dev.39 and either it never worked, or it was already broken (probably my mistake and it never worked)

is there a TL;DR anywhere that describes how to run minimal tests to make it easier to test/develop for the stdlib? Zig's test suite takes an uncomfortable amount of time to run to validate small changes

I think the expectation is to use test-filter to only run a subset of the tests

grayhatter, if 0.13-dev.39 is not a typo, that is a pre-0.13 dev build (meaning it's a dev build from just after the 0.12.0 release)

(i realize now that using an old version was probably intentional since you were checking if something regressed, whoops)

v0.13.0-dev.39+f6f7a47aa to be exact. I try to avoid updating zig because of how fustrating upgrading is across all the stdlib api changes
