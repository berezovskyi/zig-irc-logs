When do I need export vs just pub? Like if I'm making a library that I only really care about using from Zig, can I just do pub or?

when you use your library from zig as source code (not a .so or .a), simply use `pub`

hi everyone, I'm trying to build zig 0.13.0 in order to package it for Debian, and it seems that something goes wrong in finding the libraries during the build path: https://paste.debian.net/1330519/

highvoltage!~highvolta@shell.jonathancarter.org
any pointers?

looks like cmake didn't find clang

tranzystorekk!86175ff574@voidlinux/maintainer/tranzystorekk
does debian even have llvm 18?

1727382626
highvoltage!~highvolta@shell.jonathancarter.org
yep

ah I might have missed the -dev package for clang, let me double check...

1727382822
highvoltage!~highvolta@shell.jonathancarter.org
hmm no I do have it

highvoltage: go back to the cmake step, the cmake step did not succeed

andrewrk: ah thanks! it also pointed me to that I also needed libclang-cpp18-dev

What's the difference between these two: https://0x0.st/XYRs.zig like is there a time to choose to make a type with const Something = struct {} instead of fn Something() type {} and returning a struct in the function?

Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
The_Buhs, you'd only use the latter if the function takes parameters (such as type parameters)

Got it, thanks :)

Ah yeah, I see how std.SinglyLinkedList is defined as function but std.SinglyLinkedList.Node is just a const within that (since it already has the T from the function?)
