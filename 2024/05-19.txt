andrewrk: you're probably still busy with SYCL, but any chance of a FreeBSD tarball on ziglang.org/download for Zig 0.12?

I've been relying on tarballs for CI since distro packages are often out of date

FreeBSD doesn't package zig 0.12 yet unfortunately

grayhatter: I assume you're talking about running tests for the zig repo itself?

it's so you can run windows tests for the std on a linux machine, to disable use -Dskip-non-native for example

looks like you can also -fno-wine now

hey, I'm learning zig through the ziglings tutorials. I'm trying to set up a "compile-time parser" for exercise 75; here's the source: https://gist.github.com/thehowl/be3a565f9d9893266af07ae177e95534#file-a-zig-L59-L122

from what I read online, I can't return [_]Path from a function, because that syntax can only be used when initialising an array. but, since this function is meant to only be called at comptime, is there no way to return a fixed-size array based on the result of the parsing? thanks

ifreund: I am, but I figured it out, yeah, I wanted --Dskip-non-native and -Doptimize=Debug
