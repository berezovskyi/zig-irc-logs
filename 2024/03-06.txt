zig on fedora sort of sucks 

1709703781
Batzy!~quassel@user/batzy
it looks like the version you get from dnf is 0.9, but even to run zigmod i think you need 0.11?

1709703790
Batzy!~quassel@user/batzy
oh to compile zigmod you need 0.11 i mean

im having trouble using gtk4 bindings on zig?

1709704655
Batzy!~quassel@user/batzy
they have installation steps but they produce errros

1709706774
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
that says it requires 0.10.1, which probably means it will fail to build with 0.11, since the build api has not been stable

1709706789
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
also at 4 commits deep that looks like it is extremely incomplete

1709707205

yeah i gave up lo

rockorager: how do you actually use libvaxis..?

1709714927

oh i see i guess

How does one compare an anytype with null?

1709715179
Batzy!~quassel@user/batzy
im soooo miffed

1709715182
Batzy!~quassel@user/batzy
nothing in zig works lol

1709715357
Batzy!~quassel@user/batzy
what a nightmare

Unfortunately a simple `any != null` results in an error when you pass a non-optional type. I'm thinking I will have to write a function that checks for `null` constant and optionals.

I'm using std.http.Client.fetch in a test and it appears to bump the time my tests run from 4s to 12s. Curious if I'm doing something wrong here, and if there's a way to speed it up.

1709732063
copygirl!~koppeh@copy.mcft.net
Here's the code: https://git.mcft.net/copygirl/flecs-zig-ble/src/commit/b170082b516193f3c8e1aee66d37a6f8d50e7c90/src/world.zig#L293-L320

If I comment out line 311 to 317, time once again goes down to 4s. Adding a sleep or yield to the run function made no difference. (Though might be a good idea.)

1709734387

Replacing the http client with a child process that runs curl also does the trick. Back to 4s. So it's not a problem with the server somehow.

Alright, the hickup is solved in latest zig.

Hello, I have a type issue I don't understand . The code only fails in test, not with my main program.

1709734901
krichprollsch!~krichprol@mail1.atoseuronext.fr
my compile error is "error: expected type 'html.window.Window', found 'html.window.Window'"

1709734909
krichprollsch!~krichprol@mail1.atoseuronext.fr
and I have the followin notes:

1709734923

src/html/window.zig:9:20: note: struct declared here

1709734925

pub const Window = struct {

1709734990
krichprollsch!~krichprol@mail1.atoseuronext.fr
It looks like I have my type imported with a relative path on one hand and with a absolute path on the other hand, resulting two differents types?

1709735075
krichprollsch!~krichprol@mail1.atoseuronext.fr
If somebody has an idea of what's could go wrong... I will try to reproduce the issue in a small example

Nevermind I messed up, latest zig still has that slowdown.

Batzy: You probably shouldn't be getting zig from the system package manager

1709736101
brass!~brass@user/dac
It changes too frequently

Anyone handling timezones? Have a date (as a string, UTC) but want to display to user in local time

1709755226
rockorager!d72cfa7d05@2a03:6000:1812:100::3ff
I saw zig-time and zig-datetime, but neither seem to get local system time

Hey all, I am not sure how to convert [*:0]u8 into []const u8.  Specifically  I am trying to open a file given the file name in the command line, but I get the following error:

1709757331
pmk!6afe4476a1@2a03:6000:1812:100::26d
src/main.zig:76:59: error: expected type '[]const u8', found '[*:0]u8'

pmk!6afe4476a1@2a03:6000:1812:100::26d
        const fl = try std.fs.openFileAbsolute(std.os.argv[1], .{});

1709757344
pmk!6afe4476a1@2a03:6000:1812:100::26d
I was under the impression that [*:0]u8 coerces into []u8 (and []const u8) but apparently I am mistaken. Any suggestions?

Fingel!~Fingel@user/fingel
Hello, I'm trying to find docs for std.net.StreamServer, I can't find anything in https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/ but I'm wondering if this is a master vs. 0.11 thing. Is it possible to get the docs for std for 0.11? I tried just replacing the URL but got a permission denied.

1709763023
Fingel!~Fingel@user/fingel
I'm prepared if the answer is "just run master" but pacman -S zig was so easy

1709763053
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.11.0/

1709763064
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
(The links should be at the top on the left)

1709763157
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
Oh, this might be the new autodoc thing. It doesn't seem to have anything else

1709763172
Fingel!~Fingel@user/fingel
That's for the language docs, I'm looking for the std library docs

1709763187
Fingel!~Fingel@user/fingel
The link on that page does just go to master

1709763194
Fingel!~Fingel@user/fingel
I'm probably just going to install master

1709763229
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
Well for the time being I don't think the autodocs supports anything other than master

1709763243
Fingel!~Fingel@user/fingel
https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.11.0/std/#A;std works! I tried 0.11 without the trailing .0

1709763249
Fingel!~Fingel@user/fingel
thank you

1709763260
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
Oh does it

1709763298
Fingel!~Fingel@user/fingel
I guess so

1709763308
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
Fingel: Oh it does, and it's using the non-autodoc form

1709763365
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
(If it's still up, the most recent twitch stream (andrewrok) covered the autodoc version)

1709763390
Fingel!~Fingel@user/fingel
alright I'm going to get on master, but at least I can find the 0.11 docs so I can reference old code snippets online, which is helpful

1709763739
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
<rockorager> I saw zig-time and zig-datetime, but neither seem to get local system time

1709763752
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
I don't have open source code for this but getting the OS time offset is pretty straightforward

1709763808
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
on posix you can use `tzset` and windows has `GetTimeZoneInformation`

1709764378

https://zigbin.io/07469e here's a snippet that is designed mostly around short-lived programs
