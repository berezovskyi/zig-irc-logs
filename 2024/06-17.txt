andrewrk: I'm sorry I misinterpreted the scope of my question. Let me explain. I am following Window's "Create a window" tutorial, using cpp as the language. I was furthermore trying to use zig as the build system on the command line. In the end I was intending to ask: Where are the windows headers and libraries. But after sleeping on it, the answer is: Check the env of the windows developer shell. :O

fleischie, you shouldn't need to specify any include directories, here's a build.zig that works for the code in https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/learnwin32/your-first-windows-program: https://zigbin.io/f9c6a3

although i'm getting linker errors when using `-Dtarget=x86_64-windows-msvc`, unsure why that is, but targeting the MinGW abi (the default) works

(note also that i used `linkLibC` instead of `linkLibCpp` and `.c` instead of `.cpp` since C++ is not necessary for that particular code sample)

adding `exe.linkSystemLibrary("user32");` fixes the build when targeting the MSVC abi, unsure if needing that should be considered a bug

Hello, not sure if this is the right place to ask for a code review - could someone please have a look at https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/19818? I've rebased and I think all of the comments have been addressed. This PR should fix https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/19699, and hence also the problems that arise when using `cc_test` with

squeek502: Thanks for the example. It helped. My main error seems to have been either not including `linkLibCpp()` or using `linkLibC()` for my Cpp example.

unrelated: does anyone have any ideas on how to mitigate "thread leaks" when implementing the posix jobserver protocol? e.g. child process reads a thread token from the pipe, then crashes before putting the token back
