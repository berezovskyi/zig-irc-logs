I want to ask do you think zig is a good idea to make an operating system or better stick with C ?

I could drop some complicated C-Libs from my client-server project recently. Would only require networking and TLS and things like that. I'm also considering trying Zig or Hare for that but am wondering about stability

the actual language is pretty stable at this point. the standard library and build system still often have backwards-incompatible changes between releases, though

if you target the last zig stable release, you'll have less churn than if you're trying to target the bleeding edge. I semi-recently updated a decently-sized codebase from 0.11 to 0.13 and it only took a couple of hours
