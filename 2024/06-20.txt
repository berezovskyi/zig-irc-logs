interesting

so named unix socket and then the handshake you describe; wouldn't need to inherit any socket, just inherit the name

and server and client would need to keep the sockets open in order to have robust client-death detection

on that note, unix domain sockets apparently were added to windows 10 (some middle or late version). any thoughts for earlier windows support?

hello everyone! im fairly new to the zig programming language, so please pardon my ignorance :D im currently working on implementing a barebones http client, and following the GET example in the cookbook i had a question. when allocating bytes out with a general purpose allocator, what's the best practice for the total number of bytes to allocate for a buffer?

it looks like plan9 supports unix domain sockets too

with my small amount of experience in c i assume I could always reallocate to the buffer if i received a response bigger than what the buffer could hold, but my assumption could be misguided

oh so addr.sun_path bufsiz linmit. 108 on linux, 104 on the BSDs/macos. Unsure of windows.

its not immediately clear to me unnamed unix domain sockets can be used

i'm thinking it won't work to create a socketpair and let child inherit one end because we lose the dediucated connection for each client, which is in the end how robust client death will be detected

freshcoffee: can one listen and connect to the same socket? that should be inheritable to children

mm I suppose you need an address to connect to

tdback, it's expected that you'll use a fixed size buffer to receive or send data chunks, and a different one to contain larger pieces. you can't really preallocate before you know how much you need to after all.
