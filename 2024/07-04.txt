Hey y'all, does anyone know if there happens to be decent libpng (or similar) bindings for zig?

The_Buhs: I went looking for some, but didn't find any that I liked. I gave up, but that could just mean I was searching with the wrong words

grayhatter: lol that's basically where I am and the reason I asked :P

if you find anything let me know... I'm still looking :D

I'm sure I'll write one eventually... but there's like 3 other libs infront of it that I need

libpng uses setjmp/longjmp for error handling and when i fiddled around with it a couple of years ago, my error handlers would crash

which, by the way, is an absolutely atrocious way to do error handling

probably needed more callconv(.C) somewhere, but I think because longjmp unconditionally transfers flow control out of whatever the hell the calling stack was it makes it very difficult to translate failures to natural zig errors the way you can with more normal c libraries that return error codes from functions

if you just need png input/output and you have control over the inputs and you don't care too much about fancy features or compression, stb_image/stb_image_write have a dramatically simpler API

I'm trying to write a little wallpaper program just for myself to learn so theoretically I won't have full control of inputs (if someone else were to actually use it) but I'll check it out, thanks!

setjmp/longjmp was fun to work around for Lua bindings since that's what it uses for error handling as well

The_Buhs: have you looked at zigimg?

This reads and writes pngs, among other formats

rockorager: I did a bit but I wasn't sure how much of a pain it'd be dealing with their Mach-designated Zig versions rather than the official stable version

I use zigimg in a 0.13 pinned project - I just never update it :)

I'll give it a shot then :P
