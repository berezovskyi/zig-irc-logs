other languages allow to attach metadata to syntax, is there something similar in zig?

dliviu: maybe runtime resolution by executing the instruction, catching exception and then falling back to default impl?

Hi andrewrk, I'm new here, apologize for the foolish question but is this the place for asking a question related to the drop in C compiler?

leiu: yes, zig releated questions are on topic here. No need to ask to ask

Alright thanks a lot: Currently I am cross compiling binaries from C sources. Since I am really enjoying the zig language (and its build system), I experimentally switched over from the clang frontend to the zig cc. However, if I target, say a triple like "powerpc64-linux-gnu" and pass -static to the likner invocation (through the zig cc), I get a dynamically linked binary. So either I am missing

something here, or the -static argument seems to be ignored. If I use the musl libc, i.e. "powerpc64-linux-musl", I get a statically linked binary as expected. I was just wondering, why this doesn't work with the glibc?

glibc cannot (realistically) be statically linked

1712785141
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
it relies on dynamically linked nss plugins for one

1712785226
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
(It also relies on that for locale support)

That is true, but if I use the clang frontend I can provide a GNU libc.a (SYSROOT) for the target architecture "powerpc64-linux-gnu" and statically link a binary. (The sources do not depend on functions which interact with the NSS layer.) There is no problem about using the musl libc, I was just curious.

andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
it's not a good use case

1712786334
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
it just creates complications for everyone. that's why zig doesn't try to support that use case

leiu: Have a look for documentation on why glibc shouldn't be statically linked, I'd just be repeating it. It goes beyond just nss but it is largely relevant to how glibc uses dlopen and its relationship to kernel interfaces

Thanks @Earnestly I'll have a look at it.
