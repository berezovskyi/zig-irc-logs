Is anyone else having issues compiling zig compiler on Arch? I get a bunch of undefined symbol errors like `error: ld.lld: undefined symbol: ZigClangIsLLVMUsingSeparateLibcxx`

leopoldek: where did you get it from?

daurnimator: What do you mean? I'm trying to compile the latest commit of zig. LLVM I compiled myself (although the one that comes from the Extra repo doesn't work either).

daurnimator!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
leopoldek: as opposed to installing zig from extra

leopoldek: did you compile your own lld and clang as well as llvm?

1711343292
leopoldek!~leopoldek@user/leopoldek
Is that done when compiling llvm? I passed in `-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="lld;clang"`.

leopoldek: but also you can probably just download the precompiled zig from the zig homepage if you need a recent release

Well I'm maintaining zig-git on the aur I'm trying to figure out why it won't work.

1711343536
daurnimator!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
leopoldek: why did you compile your own LLVM at all? (what was the error you got using the system one?)

1711343547
leopoldek!~leopoldek@user/leopoldek
The same error.

daurnimator!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
leopoldek: it suggests zig_clang isn't being compiled/linked against correctly. can you share your PKGBUILD?

can you paste a full build log?

I did a search on discord and someone said 8 days ago that there is an issue with the version of LLVM arch uses.

He never elaborated though.

It'll take me a couple minutes to rerun the build. I'll try the system LLVM again.

Arch uses LLVM 17... not sure what issue zig would have with it specifically

Fails at building stage 3

Is zig directly compiled to machine code?

1711349256
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
in general, yes

1711349282
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
it can also be compiled to webassembly for example, which probably doesn't fit the traditional definition of machine code

1711349517
siak!~sia@2.176.234.59
nice

1711354050
Gliptic!~glip@irc.glip.cc
siak: depends on what you mean with "directly" too, it goes Zig -> ZIR -> AIR -> LLVM bitcode -> machine code

Am I the only one still having to delete zig-cache every time I build / run something?

ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
there's a fix in master, not sure if it's made it into a binary on the website yet

1711369222
rockorager!d72cfa7d05@2a03:6000:1812:100::3ff
ifreund: awesome, I should have updated before asking

1711369375
rockorager!d72cfa7d05@2a03:6000:1812:100::3ff
it's made it's way into the binary :)
