Anyone have a bare-bones ebuild example for a zig app? This is my attempt: https://bpa.st/CASQ but the linker is unhappy because it's trying to write a file `uhashfsz` when there is already a folder named that in CWD

I found ncdu in the portage tree, that appears to be the only app in tree using zig afict. It's ebuild is extensive.

In docs/labwc-theme.5.scd all single-sentence item descriptions are (consistently) without trailing period. Is this intended style ?

frmdstryr, that's not really an appropriate operation for a linked list
