I was trying to figure it out/get more info before doing that

it seems like you're taking an undisciplined approach to problem-solving. you came here yesterday with the page size issue. but now you're messing around with the build system instead of fixing the page size issue?

I'm frustrated because I'm trying to help you but you keep zig zagging around to different problems that don't need to be related to each other

a bug report provides focus where we can figure out what is happening with a fixed set of inputs

j`ey!~joey@user/jey/x-2681904
andrewrk: yes I just hardcoded the page size for now

im zig zagging as I learn more about what the build system is doing

trying to narrow down the problem

andrewrk: you mean you want to pass bytes to append to a ringbuffer? i.e. `write()`? or you want a slice to write into? i.e. `writableSlice()`?

Quick question, I'm getting this error:

1713337720
copygirl!~koppeh@copy.mcft.net
expected type '[*c]const u8', found '?[:0]const u8'

1713337731
copygirl!~koppeh@copy.mcft.net
If I pass a [:0]const u8, it works.

1713337744
copygirl!~koppeh@copy.mcft.net
If I pass a null literal, it works.

1713337807
copygirl!~koppeh@copy.mcft.net
Why is an optional slice not allowed in this case?

1713338107
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
?[*:0]const u8 is probably what you want. i wouldn't expect a slice to work here at all directly, unless there's some coercion rule I've forgotten

copygirl: arguably it should implicitly coerce to a c pointer since non optional sentinel terminated pointers do

1713338177
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
you can do foo.ptr orelse null for now

1713338207
copygirl!~koppeh@copy.mcft.net
Ah, that's shorter than `if (foo) |f| f else null`

1713338289
copygirl!~koppeh@copy.mcft.net
Ah no, optional slice doesn't expose ptr directly.

1713338452
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
er, right. the if is probably cleanest then

std.net.StreamServer is no more, what's the successor?

Is there an existing proposal / issue for returning an "anytype" from a function?

1713350697
copygirl!~koppeh@copy.mcft.net
I'm asking because I have a function called "fieldOr" that kind of works similar to @field except it provides a default value if the field doesn't exist.

1713350739
copygirl!~koppeh@copy.mcft.net
I need to explicitly specify the return type of the function (afaik) so it ends up looking kind of messy: https://gist.github.com/copygirl/d1290c2d768ac16f242aa438f7e502db

1713350841
copygirl!~koppeh@copy.mcft.net
(Though I should add this supports both declarations and fields, though intentionally.)

1713351075
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
anytype return types were rejected as a feature long ago

1713351089
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
for both technical and readability reasons
