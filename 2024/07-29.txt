Why is zig known to fail to compile in MacPorts (Catalina)?

pickanick: I don't know, that seems like a problem that should be reported to MacPorts

I'm sure they know about it; macports installer warns that zig installs are known to fail.

This above is concerning MacOS Catalina; for me, macports installer on the newer Monterey works for zig.

Hi all. I'm a bloody noob. Is there a way in zig to get the PID of the parent process, analog to getppid() in C? I found std.os.linux.getpid() but there is no std.os.linux.getppid(), so I'm a bit stuck here.

Ok, seems like about 5h ago someone had the same problem and created a pull request: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/20866

MrPink: yeah there are a couple of things like that that are simple like that but just not in the std lib yet.
