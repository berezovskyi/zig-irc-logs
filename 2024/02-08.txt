At last I have a glfw window. Turns out I was severely misinformed and how glfw links. It ends up being dynamically linked whether I like it or not, and I had to link gdi32, user32, and shell32 to my application, not glfw

maybe eventually I'll try to coerce glfw into a static lib, but not today! I have a window!

writing a build.zig for glfw helped understand what's actually going on

fengshaun, you shouldn't need to dynamically link glfw on Windows, however on Linux it will make more sense due to the way graphics drivers are loaded
