The_Buhs: you other than while (args.next()) |arg| {}

grayhatter I mean specifically for like parsing “—flag1 —param1 <param> —flag2” that sort of thing

The_Buhs!~The_Buhs@user/The-Buhs/x-5080862
I mean, if the normal way is to just iterate through with args.next() and have like a big if/else I’ll do that, just wasn’t sure

The_Buhs: the "cannon" way would be getopt or getopt_long, but, surprisingly that's not in the std lib yet

you'd be hard pressed to come up with a more example for use of comptime

more ideal* example

pass it a struct with the -params you want, have it build the if-else for you

that's basically how I'm doing user input parsing for my web app,

there are lirbaries like clap https://github.com/Hejsil/zig-clap or zig-args https://github.com/ikskuh/zig-args (or my own which is basically not documented https://github.com/torque/noclip)

So I know I can use std_options to change the log level for std.log, but is it possible to set it to change based on something at run time? I basically want a --debug cli arg that'll set it to .debug even in ReleaseXYZ optimize modes

The_Buhs: yes. set a logFn in std_options, you can basically copy the default but don’t have it be conditional on build mode

rockorager: that makes sense, thanks :)

The_Buhs: I made a couple of "fun" loggers I use on occassion if you want to reuse: https://0x0.st/XfxE.zig

I find it a lot easier to parse logs with a little color and having the prefix the same length
