ifreund: I kicked off the freebsd release builds (0.12.0, 0.12.1, 0.13.0)

how can I print a union value using the default format of the current active field? For example, I would like that for `an_union: union { i: i64, f: f64 };` the `std.debug.print("{}", .{an_union});` prints just a integer if the active field is integer, not Union{ .i = 13821 }

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:129 (message):

daurnimator!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
  ZIG_PIE was requested but CMake does not support it for "zigcpp" target

at first glance, I don't think check_pie_supported() is being used properly;

1717735807
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
instead of `AND NOT ZIG_PIE_SUPPORTED_BY_CMAKE` perhaps CMAKE_CXX_LINK_PIE_SUPPORTED and/or the C variant of that value

1717735937
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
looks to me that at the very least, `ZIG_PIE_SUPPORTED_BY_CMAKE` is set WHEN there is an error message so the logic seems backwards

omg, just noticed that ninja (samurai) on freebsd doesn't use all the cores, no wonder this has been taking so fucking long

1717740562
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
paying per hour for 32 cores and using only 1 smh

andrewrk, minor 0.13.0 release notes improvement: https://github.com/ziglang/www.ziglang.org/pull/365

1717742863
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
squeek502: thanks! a little easier to run the build this time around, eh?

1717742900
squeek502!~squeek502@user/squeek502
yeah, but why does the build.zig look for the directory `src/download/0.13.0/release-notes`?

1717742903
squeek502!~squeek502@user/squeek502
that directory doesn't exist

1717743006
squeek502!~squeek502@user/squeek502
also, if you saw my comment here: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/20047#issuecomment-2154151540 what are your thoughts on that?

1717743739
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
oh, it's an empty directory on my computer, so that's why it didn't get committed to git

1717743749
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
that's for source code examples, but I didn't end up having any

1717743768
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
see for example doc/langref/* in the main zig repo

andrewrk, what's the purpose of checking for that empty directory though?

1717743944
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
not sure if you saw my messages

1717743948
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
that's where code samples would go

1717743967
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
see for example doc/langref/* in the main zig repo

1717743996
squeek502!~squeek502@user/squeek502
ah ok, sorry looks like i disconnected so i missed some messages

"oh, it's an empty directory on my computer, so that's why it didn't get committed to git" is the only one i saw

hmm, can I pass stdout writer to a function?

andrewrk: thanks!

Amun-Ra: you can use the exact type of the writer, use anytype, or use the AnyWriter interface

Hey folks, I can't get working single threaded linking with libcxx in 0.13 : https://pastebin.com/mw35uUdS . This code compiles on 0.12.0 just fine. What am I missing? I can't see how I can force single threaded build of libcxx

Hi, this example in the manual uses a Zig source file.  Can the Zig build system create shared libraries from C files alone?    https://ziglang.org/learn/build-system/#dynamic-library

1717777233
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
lamonpan: looks like a libc++ bug to me, unless zig was supposed to exclude those files

1717780372
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
andrewrk: lamonpan: llvm18 changed things. They now conditionally build .cpp files such as shared_mutex.cpp, thread.cpp when threads are supported. We're going to have to do the same.

I'll see if I can slap together a PR

1717780572
gcarlos8!~gcarlos@37.218.246.133
how can I get reader/writer from an slice? Is there an type for that or I must create an writer from scratch?

hi guys. what i'm doing wrong here? https://privatebin.net/?194359bd5ceb8ccc#E63WMtpZx2bRMN7QBTUDunTTJSRYFuZSXkxELnZ6ArGn

1717781989
gcarlos8!~gcarlos@37.218.246.133
mkozaq: what does the error message say? Looking I suspect that it may be because you called a function on the global scope, but idk if you allowed to do it on zig

1717782306
mkozaq!~mkozaq@user/DariusL
on build no errors. running it https://privatebin.net/?b39642ff1efa32cd#AfpjcK96VpmsUwsLW26sYJzRxnYUAGuftv5AjJyyFwjb
