It's been, uh, a long while since I was around here :P  Is there a better rundown on language changes than the release notes from the last, oh, two years I think? :P

And, rumor has it that both the C backend and the amd64 backends have been rewritten in that time? :P

the C backend has been rewritten and is used in the new bootstrapping process, I believe. x86 backend is still not feature complete but has made a ton of progress afaik and is usable for some stuff (a lot of work by jacobly0 there)

big changes since uhh, 0.9? 0.10? how long ago was two years? result location semantics changed the casting builtins so they don't take a destinatino type any more, async is on probation since the C++ compiler has been sunset and will be evaluated later

fledgling package management exists now and has gotten some big improvements over the last couple of releases

I don't know if there is a good summary covering 3 or 4 releases though

noam: why not at least skim the release notes? they have exactly the content you are looking for

just read the table of contents + any sections that sound interesting

Mostly curious regarding the compiler internals and such, which tbh is probably going to just require reading the code again
