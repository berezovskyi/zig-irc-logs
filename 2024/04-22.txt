In fact these package guidelines for various package managers might be interesting just to get a sense for the number of workarounds and hacks are needed to build not just with specified features but also to build in a reproducible/sensible manner

E.g. https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Go_package_guidelines

It's from these experiences I've come down on the "don't add opinion flags to the build flags", provide opinions as some separate macro/variable if needed but leave them out of the necessary set

freshcoffee1!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
maybe just clarify `zig build --help` ?

Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
Yeah the current --release[=mode] suggests [=mode] is optional, so --release should work

1713818774
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
Otherwise the grammar should be --release=mode

1713818800
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
--release does indeed work

1713818824
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
Oh I thought it errors

1713818826
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
it errors if upstream did not choose a preferred release mode

1713818839
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
which means it doesn't really work for a distro packaging default

1713818841
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
That's not reasonable

1713818853
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
right. distros are recommended to choose a global default

1713818877
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
distros are also recommended to respect upstream's choice

1713818878
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
--release[=mode] | --release=mode-if-preferred-release-mode-not-set

1713818893
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
andrewrk: No distro will do that

1713818901
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
we will see

1713818934
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
(Such as was the case with cmake and BUILD_TYPE=Release for a long while)

1713818949
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
it is my intention for the best outcome to be what is most likely to happen by accident

1713819001
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
There's literally no reason for distros to try and incorporate build policy into not only various package managers but then also project-specific faffery as well. It's just added complexity for them, more difficulty in automation, for seemingly little gain

1713819033
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
I agree. they should not add additional policy. and then upstream's choice will be respected, as is my intention

1713819040
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
I don't know why you want to support distro packaging and then make it hard for them; why not just leave the prefered stuff to local user builds?

1713819088
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
it's not hard, it's easy. literally hardcode `--release=fast`, `--release=small`, or `--release=safe` into your zig logic and you're done

1713819110
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
Can build.zig override what those modes mean?

1713819182
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
I think it's more productive to argue with ifreund about this than you. you're just spouting dissenting opinions at me 

1713819216
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
I'm just worried you'll end up like cmake for seemingly no reason

1713819217
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
we already know we disagree. the conversation is not moving forward

1713819265
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
Fair enough, I just don't get the impression you understand the problem

1713819278
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
I won't take that bait

1713819293
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
It's not bait at all, I'm being sincere

1713819307
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
But you're right, there's no point here. ifreund can help more

1713820684
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
Heh, fedora does: sed -i "s|check_host_cflags -O3|check_host_cflags %{optflags}|" configure

grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
Earnestly: isn't it *your* job as the packer to make sure upstreams honor distro policy/expectations? Shouldn't the packer ensure that when code is built for a distro package, that it's built to the expectations of the distro? Or is it upstreams job to make sure that your package builds correctly? What about when upstream disagrees with distro policy?

1713823437
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
grayhatter: It's the packagers job to ensure it honours distro policy, but sometimes things slip through by accident

1713823448
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
upstream shouldn't really be involved at all

1713823689
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
so what's zig's job here? not add custom compile options? or not add them without documenting them? or asking permission first? or adding in hacks for each distro that wants to pre-package zig?

1713826545
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
grayhatter: Not providing the environment

1713826564
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
grayhatter: overriding* it's a matter of preference order
