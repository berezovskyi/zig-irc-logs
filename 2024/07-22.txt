is there any ongoing effort to fix the UB / UAF when returning pointers to non-existent stack frames? what’s the remaining things to do here?

I want to give it a try and hack on the compiler to make a minimal POC of my linear typing proposal

I guess it would be the easiest way to present something useful :D

is there a way to write zig code that goes on the (comptime) AST?

1721678355
hadronized!~phaazon@2001:41d0:a:fe76::1
for instance, to write extensions for the compiler, etc.

hm, maybe I can write something using std.zig

hadronized: the compiler does not support extensions...

as for your first question, some form of runtime safety check for dangling pointers to stack variables is on the roadmap

the next step towards that is research/prototyping to determine exactly what that should look like though afaik

and is not a current development priority

trying to patch zls so that it links to system musl on void, but exe.linkLibC(); doesnt seem to cut it

works for glibc though
