hi everyone! i'm new wrt/ zig, and i was wondering if it was possible to have custom stack check/protector functions (or custom prologues and epilogues)

to explain why: i would like to use zig for barebones dev and i'd like to see if perf tracing would be possible (recording start and end of each function or so), and having custom stack checks would be a nice bonus (there'd be no standard io, and having stack traces on check fail would be really nice)

No bins for illumos?  do you need a server?

llvm17 wasn't able to link zlib, zld could: https://github.com/uber/hermetic_cc_toolchain/pull/140#issuecomment-1881893887 ; felt like a small victory when it did. Granted, it was caused by llvm'

lld's stricter check on undefined symbols, but still :)
