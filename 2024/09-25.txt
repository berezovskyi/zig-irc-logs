should std.Thread.spawn(..., args: anytype) be `args: Tuple`? where `Tuple = anytype`

ifreund, torque, interesting

mountaingoat!~mountaing@user/mountaingoat
not sure if i can do it, because i need to mutate the slice at runtime, but i think i see how it would work. almost seems like black magic

i'm trying to build a static library and emit header file, and get [1]    48355 segmentation fault  zig build-lib -femit-h src/zgo.zig

1727252635
vpol!~vpol@109.111.232.126
if i remove -femit-h it works fine

mountaingoat: as torque says, this won't work for runtime mutable data

sorry if you already explained that you need runtime mutability and I missed that

hope there aren't too many zoxide clones in zig cause im about to write my own for fun :D

tranzystorekk: if you make one with the fuzzy matching algo from zf I'd use it :D

zoxide is already a clone of https://github.com/rupa/z (*oxide often means Rewritten In Rust) :p

1727253586
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
yeah, there are tones of these that existed before zoxide

1727253597
tranzystorekk!86175ff574@voidlinux/maintainer/tranzystorekk
i was going to use zf's filter yeah

1727253626
tranzystorekk!86175ff574@voidlinux/maintainer/tranzystorekk
okay, then z clones, potatoes tomatoes :P

1727253660
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
the first one I used was autojump I think, so I use j rather than z personally :D

1727253696
tranzystorekk!86175ff574@voidlinux/maintainer/tranzystorekk
i think I remember using warp, but it turned out too manual for my taste

1727253776
tranzystorekk!86175ff574@voidlinux/maintainer/tranzystorekk
or maybe it had some other name

vpol: emit-h isn't in a useful/functional state yet

1727253901
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
consider it a planned feature rather than a working feature for now :/

1727253921
vpol!~vpol@109.111.232.126
ifreund ah, i see. thanks. what is the recommended way to generate header file then? or not an option for now?

1727253940
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
one has to write them by hand for now

1727255487
mountaingoat!~mountaing@user/mountaingoat
ifreund: no, not your fault, it wasn't clear from my example

1727256111
daurnimator!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
ifreund / vpol: fun idea I've been playing with: a function in my library that spits out its own header file using zig's introspection

1727290328
tranzystorekk!86175ff574@voidlinux/maintainer/tranzystorekk
severely missing a binary encoding library :/

just gotta patch it back to 0.13 compatibility
