is there any cli tool to get information about the signature and behaviour of functions in the standard library? I mean something like man for c functions

nicos: There's no man equivalent

You can browse the std source code with a tui text editor of course though

I find that Zig's syntax and other design choices make it quite greppable

yes using ctags inside vim is a good option, but I miss man sometimes

I still read the man pages fairly often while writing zig code as they are generally the best docs on system calls
