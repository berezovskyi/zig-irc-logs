andrewrk: WSAPoll is built on top of AFD winsock calls I thought. not on top of WaitForMultipleObjects

daur: maybe poll() could be on top of NtWaitForSingleObject(). we dont know. poll() is available longer than WSAPoll(), which only supports Windows 8.1+. so it kinda destroys portability ideas.

In https://ziglang.org/learn/build-system/#running-system-tools there is sometimes an argument used in install steps called ".prefix" but it is not explained what that is and when to use. I suppose it's just the designated install path?

What I try to achieve is: I have a tool generating files from source files which should be then installed in the install directory besides the  built executable. I managed to let that happen but it generates the files in the build root first and then installs them, leaving the first built file in the build-root. I'm now searching for a way to prevent this e.g. by creating it directly to the install dir in the first

heya, is there any particular reason why zig doesn't just use cmake to look for LLVM/LLD/clang libs and uses find_library/llvm-config instead?

vimproved: which cmake version first shipped with llvm integration, and is that a too-new version, and is that support even adequate for more recent llvm versions ?

cmake doesn't need any LLVM integration for that though, LLVM just installs cmake config files when installed via cmake

is it possible to use llvm-config when cross-compiling ?

Nightwulf, use https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.Build.addInstallFileWithDir and then make your install step depend on that

yeah I was asking it as a challenge :)
