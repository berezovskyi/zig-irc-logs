Just finished ziglings. Mostly just did it to get to the comp time stuff but I did learn some other stuff,

hi anyone here using zig with neovim?

meidam!~meidam@user/meidam
I have used it with doom emacs

meidam!~meidam@user/meidam
using zls as the lsp

at least very-recent versions of neovim, as shipped in debian-unstable, seem to have some level of zig support out of the box.

meidam!~meidam@user/meidam
I would imagine that you can also use zls with neovim

I noticed quite a while back after some upgrade, it started having nice syntax highlights, and checking syntax with the zig compiler on every save, etc.  Sometimes that can be very slow

yeah I don't think the out-of-the-box bits use zls

1728387913
meidam!~meidam@user/meidam
No

worse, the ft plugin clashes with any lsp zls setup (doing autoformatting on save, printing diagnostics to a new buffer)

bblack: I'm pretty sure the "very slow" fmt/ast-check you mention is a cache miss when builing that feature from source on demand

see https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/19063

IMO this change should be reverted for zig fmt

1728389165
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
it's really bad UX to have your editor hang on save the very first time you save with zig fmt on save enabled

1728389778
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
yeah

1728389853
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
but once it's re-cached, it's super-handy even without zls, just to have nvim telling me "hey you can't save this yet, it has dumb syntax errors" :)

does anyone know how to disable that nixos ld hook "Could not start dynamically linked executable"? it messes up zig's ability to detect whether a binary needs an external executor to help run it

environment.stub-ld.enable = false;

anyone had any luck using https://github.com/batiati/mustache-zig with zig 0.13? I tried grabbing the commit that added 0.13 compatibility but it fails when comptime compiling a template
