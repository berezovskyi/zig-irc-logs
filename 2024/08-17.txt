noobie question: poking around some std code related to TLS and wanted to find why std/crypto/Certificate/Bundle/macos.zig is directly reading "/System/Library/Keychains/SystemRootCertificates.keychain" and see in issue #14169:

1723854714
cixel!~cixel@user/cixel
> this is typically done with a framework on macOS but we cannot depend on frameworks in the zig standard library

1723854714
cixel!~cixel@user/cixel
and had a few questions about this:

1723854715
cixel!~cixel@user/cixel
* why not depend on frameworks? is it an issue of cross-compilation?

1723854715
cixel!~cixel@user/cixel
* does this limitation extend to dynamically linked frameworks?

1723854716
cixel!~cixel@user/cixel
I don't know enough about macOS conventions to understand when/why this is the case, but on my system, the default keychain is my user keychain, and it doesn't seem to match the system root keychain (I'm on a work computer and we have an SSL-intercepting proxy installed; could be related and this is just an odd setup?) -- this leads to

1723854716
cixel!~cixel@user/cixel
TlsInitialization errors. I wonder if the "fault" here is the tool (Netskope) for installing in a way that ignores the system root, or std's for assuming the system root is the correct keychain to use.

1723856883
cixel!~cixel@user/cixel
(IRC logs are cooked and I don't have a bouncer set up so I may not see a reply; I think I'm just going to open a github issue)

1723861907
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
you can write a zig program that links and uses frameworks, but I believe it doesn't work for the stdlib because the framework headers can't be redistributed without apple's permission so there's no way to cross compile them

1723862034
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
I suspect it would be possible for the SSL certificate resolution stuff to more closely mimic the framework behavior in terms of trying to load from the user's keychain

1723862245
cixel!~cixel@user/cixel
I'm not really sure what the 'rules' are for framework resolution - it seems like the correct thing will always be to use `/usr/bin/security` or to use the framework

1723862385
cixel!~cixel@user/cixel
keychain** resolution

1723862465
cixel!~cixel@user/cixel
Go does some fried stuff (https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/227037) to support dynamic linking without using cgo, which I assumed wouldn't be necessary for zig, but I guess dynamic linking isn't so straightforward if you can't bundle headers

1723862822
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
I think zig could use dlopen to access framework APIs at runtime, relying on extern function declarations in the standard library

1723862839
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
that's an option that I was not aware of until recently

1723866365
cixel!~cixel@user/cixel
hm, ok. i'll mess with dlopen and dlsym. might be a fun way to learn about casting :P

1723866374
cixel!~cixel@user/cixel
thanks

1723866483
cixel!~cixel@user/cixel
in the meantime, I kinda hacked in a fix locally by patching Bundle so it checks the value of an env var to load a .pem if it's set (https://github.com/cixel/config/blob/main/home-manager/zig_cert.patch)

1723866580
cixel!~cixel@user/cixel
considering that curl, node.js, and other things that package their own certs have env vars like this, it seems like a reasonable thing to suggest for the language anyway, regardless of what the default Bundle scanning behavior is

1723866675
cixel!~cixel@user/cixel
especially once https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/14168 is in place, because it'll be necessary to get around things like Netskope or Zscaler or other things that proxy TLS

1723870174
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
How busy is this channel, anyone around?

1723870196
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
I see zig taking alot of the buzz/enthusiasm away from rust

1723870200
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
davros1: someone is usually around, but it's still IRC so there's spurts of activity

1723870245
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
davros1: I'm not sure it's taking it away from rust. Programming languages aren't a zero sum game, you could easily be excited about both rust, zig, and many other languages

1723870274
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Rust tends to be very divisive

1723870333
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Myself I was on a knife edge, the language has been a rollercoaster for me.. I've been at both extremes (a rust fanatic, and someone who finds it humiliating when it takes you capabilities away)

1723870367
gcoakes!~gcoakes@2603:8082:2000:72:264b:feff:fe90:1384
Does Alex RP frequent here? I wanted to pull the discussion on #21105 off GitHub to IRC.

1723870406
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
So I know the mindset that zig is winning with. ("We want a new language thats as powerful as C/C++, but without the clunky old syntax etc, and without the borrow checker meaning we need 500 library functions for every trivial thing"

1723870489
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
I heard that zig didn't do overloads, but looking at some zig code I do see some method call syntax

1723870502
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
It doesnt' have RAII does it, it uses defer?

1723870533
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
"t=create_thjing(); defer destroy_thing((t); ..." Right?

1723870702
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
davros1: Zig is a systems programming language that's designed to be easy to understand and write maintainable code. Part of that is it doesn't try to guess what the programmer wants. So with Zig you're expected to init and raze your objects

1723870753
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
defer is one of the ways you could raze objects

1723870760
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
I hear some people criticise RAII for its inability to pass parameters to destructors (linear types woudl be an interesting alternative)

1723870799
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
I have personally used RAII forever now but in the 'before time' I did code in C and asm

1723870813
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
("Forever" = "feels like forever at this point")

1723870948
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
I started my rust journey in 2014. Wanted to use it for gamedev. Now I saw how the rust core team (back before it was stabilised) rejected all the feedback from the games community. (Like 'safety is overkill, why not have an unsafe mode', ' can you make it easier for rapid iteration' ..)  - 10 years later, it has indeed not made inroads into gamedev. And I'm seeing peopel who try jai&zig get more done more quickly

1723870996
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Conversely there's some cases where things I disliked about rust.. by persevering (because I did fundamentally agree with some pillars like "globals are unsafe[}" for parallel code) - there's some cases where the rust team has actually turned my thinking

1723871020
txdv!~txdv@78.56.38.107
rust has a very strong focus on safety while trading development speed

1723871053
txdv!~txdv@78.56.38.107
nothing wrong with that, but some might prefer development speed for prototyping etc

1723871061
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
What surprises with rust is whilst it is indeed slower at the start, I think their super strict choices make projects easier to grow and change further down the road

1723871085
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
So my rust codebase.. whilst I got more done in less time in c++, I've been able to keep my project going for longer

1723871107
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
I never typically kept any code for longer than 3 years in c++. I always got fed up , threw it out and started again

1723871130
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Wheras ive got some code in my current project that I've been able to go back and clean up & keep working that goes back 10 years now lol

1723871146
txdv!~txdv@78.56.38.107
that is impressive

1723871157
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
I think my estimates were that rust Felt half as productive, but this aspect is a paradox

1723871187
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Any place where I have a choice that I got fed up with.. I've been able to do the big sweeping refactor to fix it

1723871217
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
And it magically "keeps working" wheras in c++ I wouldn't have expected it to ("it's easier to just rewrite at this point..")

1723871253
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
However, part of that is down to places where rust simplifies over c++ (other cases, its where it's stricter)

1723871275
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
The former statement makes me wonder if the "stick with c" people were right all along lol

1723871298
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
But the latter.. e.g. rusts ability to make newtypes really easily is handy when doing a refactor

1723871322
txdv!~txdv@78.56.38.107
try it out? since zig is advertised as being a better C 

1723871357
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
"How do I make sure I dont trip myself out with all these int indices" " just throw a wrapper in, SourceIndex(i32)" , "my_function(a:32, b:i32, SourceIndex(c):SourceIndex, d:i32)" /* makes it easier not to trip up..*/

1723871409
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
Yeah, I haven't personally done much with zig yet, but rust does make refactoring much easier, without feeling like you've missed something.

1723871431
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
Affliction: that's likely a false sense of security

1723871432
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
The way I like to explain it is that the type system is man-machine intelligence

1723871438
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
grayhatter: hence, "feeling"

1723871440
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
It lets you do things bigger than your own ability to track

1723871493
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
newtypes can largely work in any language, rust just makes them more likely to be used.

1723871539
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Yeah. In c++ I would have likely already had a tonne of overloads, breaking that "change the types and it forces you to reconsider all the calls" aspect

1723871558
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
(Which you could in principle also fix with discipline, "dont overuse overloading")

1723871582
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
davros1: that issue you're describing is one of the reasons zig doesn't have overloading

1723871624
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Does it have polymorphism (like rust has trait-bounded overload essentially)

1723871624
txdv!~txdv@78.56.38.107
I guess that is why every company has its own "how to use c++ correctly" guide, which limits the set of features dramatically

1723871636
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
That and the "no hidden control flow" aspect

1723871647
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Yeah c++ diverges into a nomber of styles

1723871651
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
davros1: kinda, sorta, not really. Structs with function pointers.

1723871659
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
see eg, Allocator

1723871660
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
davros1: no, it has comptime

1723871677
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
I was going to say at this point I'd never voluntarily work with another person on a  c++ project ever again, the extent to which it encourages coworker fights

1723871693
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
oh, yeah, comptime for static dispatch, self-defined vtables for dynamic

1723871709
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
scroll through std/mem.zig

1723871726
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
And I say  to myself that "the rust restrictions would win in a team environment" - but ive also found it helpful for growing my own codebase ( doing big sweeping refactors)

1723871742
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
because explicit is better than implicit, the polymorphism is a variable

1723871777
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
davros1: lately I've been using a lot of `enum(u32) { _ }` with convenience methods added

1723871802
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
basically, you wrap an integer, making it have type safety and convenience methods, but get zero cost runtime code for it, as if it were an integer

1723871820
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Comp time for static dispatch.. would that be stuff like.  "Fn add(alb){. If type=X { handle that} else if type=Y{handle that} /* same end result as having add(:X), add(:Y)" ?

1723871820
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
but, you're free to accept an var: anytype, and switch (@typeOf(var))

1723871891
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
That sound quite like rust newtypoes

1723871908
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
("Ernum (u32)" .. not sure what that does but ..

1723871944
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Another place rust won me over is enum/match , I found that inbuilt tagged unions do change how you (well I) code 

1723871986
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
"c++ , I'll just throw a load of extra bool parameters in here (known bad stye)" => "rust, very easy to express the concept properly a an enum"

1723872035
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Not sure what my goal was jumping into this channel today .. curiosity 

1723872053
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
I sort of feel some envy to how fast I see zig people get stuff done lol

1723872081
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
But I also find myself wanting to defend rust if they trash talk it (some bias down to the fact I've been using rust so long at this point)

1723872128
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Its quite possible if zig was around in 2015 or so .. it would have suited me better

1723872183
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
I'm content to try a bit of both

1723872189
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
I also figure another langauge switch would be a net negative for me at this point sadly

1723872208
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
(Given the other lesson - how long it takes to adapt after you build habits)

1723872218
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
Though rust-analyzer has spoiled me, heh. zls isn't quite there yet, but still better than nothing.

1723872266
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Yeah maybe 5 years of delay for me in liking rust enough to want it for my main project, but for most of that time C++ IDEs were much better

1723872320
txdv!~txdv@78.56.38.107
zig is pretty slick in terms of learning, the language has a strong focus on not introducing redundant features, so the feature set to learn is smaller but its powerful

1723872329
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
"Messy language with good IDE wins vs better language with plain text editor" was a conclusion , but I stubbornly persevered. And some time between 2018-2021 .. I found rust analyzer improved a lot

1723872388
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
I did appreciate taht rusts syntax tweaks made plain greps easier (try finding the function defs in c++ lol)

1723872406
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
I note zig does the same thing "fn ..."

davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
I'd guess that JAI, Zig, Odin would beat rust in gamedev . However, the community will be split between them. 

1723872531
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Rust at this point .. it's fair to say is not winning the game development community over, it remains C++ dominant

1723872541
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
jai, has that been released?

1723872564
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
haven't heard of odin

1723872576
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Not really but jblow's elitist community selection seems to yield the same sort of thing , "peopel who try it get a lot done quickly"

1723872607
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Odin has some similarities with both JAI,Zig

1723872638
txdv!~txdv@78.56.38.107
might be biast, because only very experienced devs get to use JAI, obviously they are productive already nevermind what language they use

1723872671
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Yeah  . And he makes it clear, "he's targeting experienced devs anyway"

1723872674
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
SOA listed on the main page as a first class feature, nice. I think zig has similar capabilities.

davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Inbuilt matrices is interesting but I personally just enjoy what they criticise.. templates etc letting you build complicated structures in the langauge

I've been pleasantly surprised by how much LLVM can autovectorize

1723872869
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
I haven't gone hard on SIMD opt yet because I'm targeting wasm aswell but I think between rust macros & generics , and LLVM's autovectorizing, I'll be able to get good. SIMD utilisation

1723872894
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Out of the box I was seeing llvm autovectorize 4x4 matrices just fine (which was a pleasant surprise)

davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
What I dont have is much avx2 8xf32 use. But ARM & neon out there make me focus on 4xf32 

1723872998
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
I have SIMD on my mind right now because Zen5 beefs up AVX512 support , that could be a game changer for cpu approach

1723873018
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
(Like the gap from how you code for 4xf32 to 16xf32 is bigger)

1723873021
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
people are on pretty good behavior here. I don't think we've had a person trash talking Rust in many months

1723873106
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
And the rust community itself also invites a defensive reaction , pretty much "you can't be trusted .. ", "you must rewrite in this safe langauge" (-> well no)

1723873127
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
well, let's not start generalizing about the rust community please

1723873147
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
"Extreme elements of .." Perhaps

davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
In just about any programming space I'll see divisive arguments over it very quickly

1723873183

It is a very polarising language .

random q: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Community links to https://marler8997.github.io/zig-irc-webpage/?date=2024-08-17 for history, but it 404s and it looks like the source repo (https://github.com/marler8997/zig-irc-logs) hasn't been written to since 2022 - is there another? or is the service that was doing logging defunct?

Its a nice achievement to get traction for a language

1723873839
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
I did have a bash at building 'my ideal pet language' but whilst I got it working I quickly concluded I wouldnt' be able to get traction so I gave up on it

1723873953
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
My plan was something that could be transpilable with more of a c++ subset for a migration path but I never got as far as trying that out

1723873969
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
Anyone can cobble together a parser and code gen. Few have the patience to see it through to something genuinely useful. Fewer release what they've built and subject it to criticism of the masses.

1723874046
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
There's probably hundreds of working languages out there but only a few get popular

1723874080
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
I mentioned the IDE support, I replied I'd never be able to do all that lol

1723874129
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
And there was a long time during which rust itself had everything I needed, but it was just lack of IDE support keeping me going back to C++ (id' have had the same problem with my pet language)

1723874163
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
Yeah, tooling's important.

1723874327
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
I also figured it would be bad for my mental health to retreat into my own little world like that, I figured persevering with the contrary views I was getting from Rust people would broaden my mind more

1723874349
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
And indeed there were a few aspects in which they changed my mind on some things 

1723874373
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
My pet lang had all the adhoc c++ overloads. Whch I now accept are a "misfeature"

1723875464
gcoakes!~gcoakes@2603:8082:2000:72:264b:feff:fe90:1384
Has anyone else encountered aborted tests due to ProcessFdQuoteExceeded when running `zig build test-std -fqemu -fwasmtime -fwine` on a many-core system? I changed my command to add `-j1` and now it is working (I think). I tried raising the FD limit, but that didn't seem to be enough.

1723876764
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
I don't know anything about rust, but I am willing to go buck wild insulting C++ 24/7 if the situation demands it

1723906791
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Does zig have a 'context' like jai

1723906815
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
I hear some jai people saying there's a 'context' implicitely passed around holding the allocator, or somethign like that

1723907204
gcoakes!~gcoakes@2603:8082:2000:72:264b:feff:fe90:1384
You could always just use a global allocator if you're application desires to only use one allocator.

1723907277
gcoakes!~gcoakes@2603:8082:2000:72:264b:feff:fe90:1384
If you want to go really crazy, you could probably do some kind of `fn pushAllocator` and `fn popAllocator` with a global `var allocator_stack = std.DoublyLinkedList(std.mem.Allocator){}`.

1723907487
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Push/pop would need to get the thread id I think 

1723907513
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Or could operate on something in 'thread local storage' I guess (I'm not sure how performant the out of the box mechanisms are for that)

1723907542
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
This might be the problem jai is solving with its context (the rust way is "you just make and pass context around, explicitely")

1723907545
gcoakes!~gcoakes@2603:8082:2000:72:264b:feff:fe90:1384
Oh, yeah, you would probably need a TLS var.

1723907616
gcoakes!~gcoakes@2603:8082:2000:72:264b:feff:fe90:1384
What do you think JAI would be doing differently? Are they passing it as an implicit function argument?

1723907624
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
I thinks

1723907628
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
I think so

1723907633
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
I'm not sure exactly though

1723907656
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
The way people talked about it.. "just throw the globals in it"

1723907726
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
One thing in rust that really resonates with me, I do strongly dislike global variables and agree with their choice to make then "unsafe{}" to mutate

1723907809
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
But if you had some implicit per-thread pointer that you could throw stuff in as easily as adding global vars, it might give the best of both worlds

1723907943
gcoakes!~gcoakes@2603:8082:2000:72:264b:feff:fe90:1384
You don't need `unsafe{}` for global variables in Rust. You just need something to ensure exclusivity.

1723907996
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Right. "Without a safe wrapper, mutable globals are unsafe"

1723908031
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Exlucsive to a thread? How would you signal it or know which thread you're in .. so in practice in a multithreaded codebase , globals need sync primitive.

1723908060
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
(& rust is designed for multithreaded codebases first and foremost)

1723908092
companion_cube!~simon@user/meow/companion-cube:68572
if you use TLS you're good, they can't be accessed by other thredads but then they're not true globals

1723908106
companion_cube!~simon@user/meow/companion-cube:68572
anyway in Odin I think the context is passed as a hidden argument, and stored on the stack

1723908111
companion_cube!~simon@user/meow/companion-cube:68572
idk about jai

1723908159
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
I have hazy memory that TLS isn't quite as versatile as a pointer to a context object.. something like 'its fudged as an x86 segment register (?)

1723908214
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Is comp time versatile enough to insert a context object pointer ? (I think JAI has some kind of 'let the user modify the AST at compile time..)

1723908275
gcoakes!~gcoakes@2603:8082:2000:72:264b:feff:fe90:1384
Insert it where?

1723908313
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Literally stuff an extra argument (I'm not sure what zig comp time can & cant do)

1723908502
gcoakes!~gcoakes@2603:8082:2000:72:264b:feff:fe90:1384
Into a function call signature? I don't think that would be a good idea even if you could. You could probably do something crazy like create a "decorator" function which wraps a function, but I don't know how you would make that visible to the wrapped function.

1723908608
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
(Does zig have local functions ?)

1723908622
gcoakes!~gcoakes@2603:8082:2000:72:264b:feff:fe90:1384
Meaning closures?

1723908644
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Not quite - distinct from closures in that they're just normal functions, that just happen to be limited in scope

1723908659
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
(No variable capture)

1723908684
gcoakes!~gcoakes@2603:8082:2000:72:264b:feff:fe90:1384
You can do `const func = struct { fn impl() void {} }.impl;`, if that's what you're asking.

1723908729
gcoakes!~gcoakes@2603:8082:2000:72:264b:feff:fe90:1384
It's not pretty. Superficial as that may be, it keeps me from using most of the time compared to just file scoped, private functions.

1723908749
gcoakes!~gcoakes@2603:8082:2000:72:264b:feff:fe90:1384
*file scoped => scoped to the current type

1723908792
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Trying to pick up more of zig's syntax.. I'm guessing thats creating an empty local stunt, I see C++ -esque declaration of functions inside a type? Woudl those come with implicit "this *" or not

1723908815
gcoakes!~gcoakes@2603:8082:2000:72:264b:feff:fe90:1384
No, there are no implicit arguments in Zig.

1723908838
gcoakes!~gcoakes@2603:8082:2000:72:264b:feff:fe90:1384
But, yes, it is a locally defined struct. It can capture comptime variables, but nothing from runtime.

1723908867
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
My model is something like "zig = c + (rust- Cplusplus)" if you were to categorise languages in a vector space lol

1723908919
davros1!~davros2@host86-184-190-18.range86-184.btcentralplus.com
Maybe there's a better way to describe it. Also I see this sort of thing "for (..) |x| { ....}" which reminds me of rusts deleted "do notation", what is that doing exactly

1723909048
gcoakes!~gcoakes@2603:8082:2000:72:264b:feff:fe90:1384
It's capturing a single item at a time from whatever iterable is given in `for (..)`. https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#for

1723909087
gcoakes!~gcoakes@2603:8082:2000:72:264b:feff:fe90:1384
Iterable is something defined by the compiler for specific types, not something generally implementable from user code.

1723909354
gcoakes!~gcoakes@2603:8082:2000:72:264b:feff:fe90:1384
Does anyone know what version of wine is used by the x86_64-linux-{debug,release} CI jobs? I'm trying to get my local repo to pass all the tests from `zig build test-std`. I was previously just testing with `-Dskip-non-native`, but now, I need to fix an issue that seems exclusive to wine. I'm getting errors related to wine functions not being

1723909355
gcoakes!~gcoakes@2603:8082:2000:72:264b:feff:fe90:1384
implemented.

1723926225
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
gcoakes: debian?

1723926279
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
either way, functions don't often go "missing" so update to the newest version of wine, and see if that doesn't fix the issue

1723926296
gcoakes!~gcoakes@2603:8082:2000:72:264b:feff:fe90:1384
I don't have the issue locally. The CI does.

1723926306
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I don't think zig expects to pin to a specific verison of wine, so once you're sure you have... ahh

1723926327
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
the CI is probably running debian, so wine from 10 years ago probably 

1723926345
gcoakes!~gcoakes@2603:8082:2000:72:264b:feff:fe90:1384
In fact, I can't reproduce it locally. I'm trying to figure out how to reproduce it.

1723926376
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
[hyperbole for the humor because I'm constantly annoyed by debian's repos]

1723926425
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
you're trying to fix a CI issue, or you fixed an issue, and CI fails but it passes locally?

1723926537
gcoakes!~gcoakes@2603:8082:2000:72:264b:feff:fe90:1384
I think I'm just going to sidestep the issue anyways because that is a symbol from kernel32.dll, and the Zig std library wants to use ntdll.dll. I'm pretty sure NtUnmapViewOfSection will work since it seems to be used in other parts of the standard library.

1723926631
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
this feels like a zig build bug

1723926865
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I'm surprised that zig will attempt to link kernel32.dll, but only ntdll.dll on CI. I'd have assumed that if it worked locally, it would also work CI. In this case, I'd have assumed it wouldn't try to link kernel32.dll

1723927753
Synon!~Synon@user/Synon
I need help understanding one thing: why do I get integer overflow when trying to store @intFromBool(...) + @intFromBool(...) + @intFromBool(...) into an u8?

1723927766
Synon!~Synon@user/Synon
the max value should be 3, how does that overflow an u8?

1723927783
LAC-Tech!~lewis@granite-phrase.bnr.la
what's the type of the int?

1723927871
Synon!~Synon@user/Synon
u8

1723927886
Synon!~Synon@user/Synon
wait nevermind

1723927892
Synon!~Synon@user/Synon
@intFromBool() returns a u1

1723927930
Synon!~Synon@user/Synon
I mean still... u8 = u1 + u1 + u1; should be fine no?

1723927939
Synon!~Synon@user/Synon
I can work around it by doing += over 3 lines instead

1723927955
Synon!~Synon@user/Synon
or by wrapping each @intFromBool() inside a @as(u8, ...)

1723928114
Synon!~Synon@user/Synon
I feel like @intFromBool() can be useful when used to add a lot of bools together in one line, would be great if that was made possible

1723928124
Synon!~Synon@user/Synon
like to check of at least n of m conditions are true

1723928883
gcoakes!~gcoakes@2603:8082:2000:72:264b:feff:fe90:1384
Maybe you would be better off using a enum set or just normal integer flags. With the latter, you even could do @popCount to get the count more efficiently using hardware instructions where available.

1723930060
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
Synon: yeah, I hate that feature of Zig myself

1723930117
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
in my head `u32 = 16 + 16` shouldn't overflow but it does. Zig see it is u32 = u16(u16 + u16)

1723930171
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
which feels even more wrong because it'll promote comptime_int :/

1723931129
Synon!~Synon@user/Synon
grayhatter: yeah that's sad

1723931218
Synon!~Synon@user/Synon
gcoakes: actually I have a bunch of methods isThis(), isThat() and I have methods that will check them, I also have a method that will check all of them and only return true if 5 of 8 conditions are true (doesn't matter which)

1723931264
gcoakes!~gcoakes@2603:8082:2000:72:264b:feff:fe90:1384
Ah, gotcha.

1723931265
Synon!~Synon@user/Synon
In C, I would just add the "booleans" together since booleans are just numbers

1723931294
gcoakes!~gcoakes@2603:8082:2000:72:264b:feff:fe90:1384
Yeah, I think `@as` is the correct way then.

1723931326
Synon!~Synon@user/Synon
@as(u8, @intFromBool(...)) works, it's just a bit too verbose IMHO

1723931336
Synon!~Synon@user/Synon
yeah, that's what I ended up doing

1723931354
Synon!~Synon@user/Synon
thanks for the help though :D

1723932815
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
you only need to wrap one of them in the @as(u8)

1723932825
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
the rest will be promoted

1723933130
Synon!~Synon@user/Synon
torque: oh nice thanks!

1723933202
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
the problem, I believe, is that the intermediate expression is only as wide as the widest involved type. I think this behavior predates much of the result location semantics stuff and it would be nice if the intermediate expression could be promoted to the result type if one is available
