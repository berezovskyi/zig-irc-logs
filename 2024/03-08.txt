testing zig 0.12.0-dev.3161+377ecc6af, doing a `zig init` makes an additional file: "build.zig.zon". What is this file?

1709866041
masoudd!~masoudd@user/masoudd
I guess https://zig.guide/master/build-system/zig-build is not updated to the new thing?

1709866175

Think of it as Zig's version of package.json, composer.json, go.mod, and so on.

"Andrew replied to a post I made about this blog in ziggit" Ah yeah, Ziggit. Got banned from there within just a few minutes after registration for saying that I prefer to say "Go user" and "Rust user" over "Gopher" and "Rustacian" respectively. Such snowflakes!

you sound like a troublemaker

andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
I don't really want to spend time larping as sherlock holmes to find out if people are troublemakers, so if I get the slightest whiff of trouble I just ban them and move on with my day. I suggest to not make any smells

I know you're a BDFL, and I'm perfectly fine with that. But if it's even impossible to have your own opinion, then what's even the point of running a community?

no more off topic please

I'm confused. https://zig.guide/language-basics/if it says: """Zig's if statements accept bool values (i.e. true or false). Unlike languages like C or Javascript, there are no values that implicitly coerce to bool values.""" But on the "Optionals" chapter it says: """if (b) |value| captures the value of b """ and b is not a bool. it's a ?i32. is ?i32 bool?

1709874978
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
there are actually 3 separate forms of the if statement

1709874996
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
the standard one, which does not have a payload, which operates exclusively on booleans

1709875022
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
the second one, which has a payload on the `if` statement, which operates on optional values and captures the unwrapped value in the payload

1709875058
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
and teh third one, which has payloads on both the `if` and `else` statements, which operates on error unions and captures the non-error result in the `if` payload and the error result in the `else` payload

1709875106
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
this is shown here: https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#if but not really explicitly written out very well

1709875423
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
note that while statements have the same semantics

1709875997
masoudd!~masoudd@user/masoudd
I see. Thank you

does anyone know of good imgui bindings for zig that are up to date? (preferably where rebuilding the bindings for a different version is trivial since I need a specific version)

Is there something like `zig fmt` for c/c++?

1709920989
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
there's clang-format

1709921036
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
there are a few other formatters for c/c++ but I think clang-format is the most well-known one nowadays

1709921228
voldial!~voldial@user/voldial
torque: ah. that works. TY

1709926708
voldial!~voldial@user/voldial
torque: can you point me to one of the alternaives? I read and tested everything related (afict) in https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html and `clang-format -style=llvm -dump-config > .clang-format` and am stuck trying to figure out how to get it to align func args in a return statement, like this: https://bpa.st/2LWA

1709926812
voldial!~voldial@user/voldial
... trying astyle

torque!~tachyon@user/torque
the other one I know of off the top of my head is uncrustify

1709927259
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
since C/C++ have been around for a long time, there are many different styles different groups have adopted over the years and I don't really like any of them. when I write C I just manually format it and force others to do the same

1709927491
voldial!~voldial@user/voldial
torque: thanks, digging through uncrustify's options now
