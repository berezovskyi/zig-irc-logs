andrewrk, you just commented on a PR I made. Would you mind helping me to understand it a bit better? What does the ideal fuzz test look like for you when cross-input context is implemented? You had mentioned using a function callback here a few nights ago. When I sat down to write it, I felt an iterator was a more ergonomic way of achieving the same thing. Both a function callback and an iterator pattern would require significantly ch

Is there a language feature that allows defining methods on primitive types? Like if I have a `const Word = u256` and I want to define a `fn toBytes(self: Word) [32]u8`

Synon: you could make Word a non-exhaustive enum: `enum(u256) { _ }` and define functions in that namespace

ifreund: Sorry I just saw your reply. That sounds okay I guess, I didn't know there were non-exhaustive enums at all

Oh but I have to use @intFromEnum every time I want to use it as a number and do arithmetic operations with it

andrewrk: I hate to be a pain but I'm getting some pushback by the sublime package people about putting my unofficial package on their registry

I think they're partially looking for your approval?

if it's completely out of your wheelhouse / irrelevant I'm happy to just buzz off though

who are the sublime package people?

do you mean package control?

aidenfoxivey!08de0355d2@2a03:6000:1812:100::e41
grayhatter: yes, sorry, sublime package control

IIRC wbond used to work for sublime text, but doesn't anymore, which would make it also unofficial... But, given the justified concerns about attacks against package repos, I suspect they're looking for some layer of additional confidence. It's likely only way to get that is gonna be with time

Okay, fair enough

I'm not like terribly concerned about being there other than having people able to use it so they can report issues with it

If I were you, I'd maintain the private fork for a while, and importantly, open a PR to the main repo, and keep the PR up to date
