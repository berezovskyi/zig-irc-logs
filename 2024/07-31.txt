is there a way to heap allocate something with an explicit length? ie mem.Allocator.alloc returns []T, is there anyway to get [N]T ?

LAC-Tech: for example, Allocator.create([42]u8)

Ah! Yes, of course create would work. Sorted, thanks.

while I think the above example is better, note that slicing a slice with a comptime-known range will get you a pointer to an array, so given []T, t[0..42] would get you a *[42]T

of course the slice needs to actually be big enough
