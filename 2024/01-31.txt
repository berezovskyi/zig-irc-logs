ifreund: It does seem obvious in retrospect, but since other bits of the hash map docs are explicit about invalidating things (iterators) I didn't think about it. I will open a PR when I get some free time; possibly tonight :)

I know I'm late to the party, but jacobly0 do you just want to use allocators idiomatically? Because things in the standard library just take an Allocator, not a *Allocator.

Is there a Zon parser hiding somewhere in std? It seems like a convenient configuration format (nicer than JSON) but I don't see a library for it. Is build.zig just compiling the build.zig.zon file?

torque!~tachyon@user/torque
there's a work in progress PR for that https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/17731 but it is currently integrated directly into the compiler

leeward!~sask@cust-95-128-93-211.breedbanddelft.nl
I figured it was something like that, thanks.

andrewrk: Looks like I can't cross-compile the Zig compiler. Just `zig build` (on Linux) works, but `zig build -target x86_64-openbsd` and `zig build -target x86_64-freebsd` don't. Verified the same problem with `zig build -target x86_64-windows`, which I only did to verify whether it's an issue with just the BSD's not being supported or not.

1706694519
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
Zig version is 0.12.0-dev.2341+92211135f.

1706694541
leeward!~sask@cust-95-128-93-211.breedbanddelft.nl
Well, I guess this machine can't compile Zig. Took the whole thing out.

1706694637
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
0.11.0 are available in the repositories of both BSD's, just as a side note.

1706695176
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
remiliascarlet: this information is pretty useless without logs showing the error message you get

1706695177
leeward!~sask@cust-95-128-93-211.breedbanddelft.nl
Or maybe it can if I tell it to only use one thread?

1706695308
leeward!~sask@cust-95-128-93-211.breedbanddelft.nl
\o/ Ok, I can build Zig on this machine it just takes a little over 10 minutes.

I just realized that Loris didn't tell us to subscribe or click the bell. So refreshing.

remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
Ankhers: I saw it, but not too much interesting stuff this time, mostly just financial stuff. Maybe we'll get the major stuff during the Milan event.

1706717317
Ankhers!e99e97ef8e@2a03:6000:1812:100::2a2
I haven't been able to finish it yet. I was hoping to get an understanding of what was going on. I am trying to decide if I want to learn Zig as my next language.

1706717388
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
I'd say, give the Ziglings excercises a try, and make a decision based on that.

1706717468
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
And also understand the type of programs you want to make. If you want to make games, then certainly Zig is a great language. But if you want to make web-based backends, then maybe Go is a better fit.

1706717470
Ankhers!e99e97ef8e@2a03:6000:1812:100::2a2
Thanks. I will take a look through that. I started going through zig.guide, but it didn't really feel like what I needed.

1706717502
Ankhers!e99e97ef8e@2a03:6000:1812:100::2a2
I have been using Elixir for the last almost 10 years. I am good for the web backend stuff.

1706717566
Ankhers!e99e97ef8e@2a03:6000:1812:100::2a2
I did want a language more in line to build something closer to a desktop app.

1706717584
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
I was going to give you the link to the repository, but it looks like Codeberg is currently broken.

1706717594
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
So once they fix it: https://codeberg.org/ziglings/exercises

1706717624
Ankhers!e99e97ef8e@2a03:6000:1812:100::2a2
It seems to work for me.

1706717630
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
"desktop app" A desktop is not an iPhone.

1706717647
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
Yeah, now it works for me too.

1706717676
Ankhers!e99e97ef8e@2a03:6000:1812:100::2a2
Yes. I was also thinking of tinkering with mobile development with it. I have done stuff in cpp and rust for mobile development (nothing game related). So I thought I would try that again for a new project I hope to work on.

1706717718
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
I've never done mobile development, I hate smartphones.

1706717734
Ankhers!e99e97ef8e@2a03:6000:1812:100::2a2
Me too, but other people can't get off of them...

1706717753
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
Then don't feed the beast.

1706717809
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
The more we move from desktop and/or web browsers to smartphones, the more we lose the freedom of platforms.

1706717944
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
I'd be more OK with smartphones if we'd go from desktop + web to desktop + web + mobile. But instead we're increasingly going from desktop + web to mobile-only.

1706717983
Ankhers!e99e97ef8e@2a03:6000:1812:100::2a2
Yeah. That is not generally the approach that I take. But I completely get what you are saying.

1706719770
Ankhers!e99e97ef8e@2a03:6000:1812:100::2a2
Does anyone know if there is something already built to get a development version of zig in nix? I can build it out myself if nothing currently exists.

1706720115
braewoods_!~braewoods@user/braewoods
Ankhers, are you asking for essentially for a nightly build repository for some Linux distribution?

1706720136
braewoods_!~braewoods@user/braewoods
s/for essentially//

1706720165
Ankhers!e99e97ef8e@2a03:6000:1812:100::2a2
braewoods_: Yes. I was just wondering if someone else had already done the work for the nix package manager.

1706720239
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
Ankhers: Simply download the archive for Linux, extract it, put it somewhere, configure your $PATH variable to it, and you're good to go.

1706720244
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
No need to compile anything.

1706720265
Ankhers!e99e97ef8e@2a03:6000:1812:100::2a2
That doesn't really work on nixos. You can't download and run arbitrary binaries.

1706720272
Ankhers!e99e97ef8e@2a03:6000:1812:100::2a2
I could patch the binary though.

1706720286
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@user/remiliascarlet
Sounds like a hopeless distro then.

1706720347
Ankhers!e99e97ef8e@2a03:6000:1812:100::2a2
To each their own.

andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
Ankhers, if you're talking about the zig tarballs, you are mistaken. they do work on nixos

1706731015
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
statically linked binaries work fine on nixos

1706731023
Ankhers!e99e97ef8e@2a03:6000:1812:100::2a2
Oh. I didn't realize it was statically linked.

1706731062
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
not only that but zig detects the native dynamic linker at runtime so you will be able to link with libc and use the compiler with no issues on nixos

1706731069
Ankhers!e99e97ef8e@2a03:6000:1812:100::2a2
andrewrk: I still prefer to use nix where possible, but I appreciate the fact it is statically linked.
