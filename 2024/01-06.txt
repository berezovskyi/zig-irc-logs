starting to learn zig. what's the way that you all deal with unused argument errors in partially written functions, that you want to compile and test anyway

try assigning it to underscore

Hey folks. I tried bootstrapping Zig without LLVM again. This time it fails with different error:

1704577020

sskras!sid542048@id-542048.tinside.irccloud.com
Is that know thing, or should I file new issue?

1704577293
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
sskras, hmm we have the x86_64-linux CI script ensuring that this process completes successfully. can you share more about your environment?

1704577339
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
here's what gets tested with every commit: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/42389cb9c58cfe71db055142eb7b8cc15193ddf9/ci/x86_64-linux-debug.sh#L25-L27

1704577345
sskras!sid542048@id-542048.tinside.irccloud.com
It's all the same Ubuntu as mentioned in my older issue: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/18050

1704577368
sskras!sid542048@id-542048.tinside.irccloud.com
I could only add that it runs in a OpenVZ container. I hoped that shouldn't have any impact.

1704577451
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
which commit did you last try this with?

1704577547
sskras!sid542048@id-542048.tinside.irccloud.com
It's 42389cb9c (I think newest ATM(

1704577569
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
yeah that's brand spanking new

1704577597
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
hmm maybe I can try to reproduce your results in a docker container. so it's ubuntu 20.04 yeah?

1704577610
sskras!sid542048@id-542048.tinside.irccloud.com
2 months ago it failed with a very different message, so I am not sure if it's worth adding a new issue.

1704577622
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
we can continue to use this #18050, no problem

1704577662
sskras!sid542048@id-542048.tinside.irccloud.com
Description:    Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS

1704577698
sskras!sid542048@id-542048.tinside.irccloud.com
I am going to try the short cmd from the line #27 that you linked

1704577868
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
I'm trying it too in a docker container for ubuntu:focal

1704578019
sskras!sid542048@id-542048.tinside.irccloud.com
Docker is quite a different beast from OpenVZ, so I have no idea if the build would behave the same on this host (the provider's machine) but using different technology to run guests... Let's see.

1704578071
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
it shouldn't really matter if it is executing inside a virtual environment or not

1704578431
sskras!sid542048@id-542048.tinside.irccloud.com
True. But this service I use feels a bit strangely (caps CPU and Disk I/O in a very brutal way). Usually I use pkgsrc system to build different versions of GCC, and here this build system already experienced some random failures with messages like "cannot fork" or "resource unavailable" to me several times. But after rerunning the build it continues just fine. So that might have been some revealed race conditions.

1704578442
sskras!sid542048@id-542048.tinside.irccloud.com
While in Zig's case it's always the same.

1704578484
sskras!sid542048@id-542048.tinside.irccloud.com
So maybe that's unrelated.

1704578522
sskras!sid542048@id-542048.tinside.irccloud.com
Do you know what distro is used for running the CI script?

1704578750
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
debian

1704578757
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
basically the same as ubuntu

1704578797
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
sskras, can you update that issue's original comment with up to date information? (version used, error output, etc)

1704578822
sskras!sid542048@id-542048.tinside.irccloud.com
Sure

1704579068
sskras!sid542048@id-542048.tinside.irccloud.com
Ah, I see that I use `./bootstrap build` and CI script uses just `./bootstrap`. Could that make the difference?

1704579141
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
when I first made that bootstrap script, I had it also accept args to forward to zig build after it was done but I decided later to simplify it. now the bootstrap executable ignores all args

1704579180
sskras!sid542048@id-542048.tinside.irccloud.com
Ack

1704579542
sskras!sid542048@id-542048.tinside.irccloud.com
Added a comment. Anything's missing?

1704579752
sskras!sid542048@id-542048.tinside.irccloud.com
I see your comment, that's strange. Could you please also share the output of lsb_release -d (if any) ?

1704579852
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
you can easily reproduce this environment with `docker run -it ubuntu:focal`

1704579892
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
I think that's as much as I'm willing to look into it currently, sorry. I have a lot of other tasks to get to today

1704580053
sskras!sid542048@id-542048.tinside.irccloud.com
Thanks, that's quite an idea â€“ running Docker container inside OpenVZ container :)

1704580065
sskras!sid542048@id-542048.tinside.irccloud.com
Will try.

1704580524
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
I'm not suggesting using docker as a workaround. rather, I'm using it to try to reproduce your environment. since it worked fine, I think you might need to dig around on your end to figure out what's different

1704580633
sskras!sid542048@id-542048.tinside.irccloud.com
Sure, now it's just the quickest way for me to try your recipe. If that works, differences will be right at my hand. All's fine :)
