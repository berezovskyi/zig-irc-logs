Hi! I'm trying to figure out why my code is throwing a segfault. The last call from my code is to .create() on a std.mem.Allocator. The stack trace ends up at std.mem.alignBackward with both addr and alignment of 0, which looks like it should fail the assertion. One step up the stack has std.mem.isAlignedGeneric with alignment of 8 and a nonzero addr. I must be missing something because that doesn't make sense to me.

is your source code available? what optimization level did you compile it with?

Hmm, looking closer, I think I overflowed the stack.

Not available right now, I'm sketching an idea out. I didn't set any optimization level -- I guess debug? But segfault on stack overflow makes sense. Not sure how that gets the zeroes I saw though.

debug is normally the default yeah. afaik a stack overflow would segfault on all optimization modes

Alright, I have an unbounded recursion issue, I'll fix that. Thanks!
