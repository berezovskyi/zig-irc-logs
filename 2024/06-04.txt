is there a better way to access a bare union field than if (union == .tag)?

I can't modify the struct, it's a windows defined struct with a union in it

rockorager: if I understand what you mean, if you define it as an extern union, and then use anonmous as the tag for the bare union member

grayhatter: Heh, I have no idea what I mean but I have a working solution

I also found this comment which is what I am seeing too: https://github.com/ziglibs/zig-windows-console/blob/441a1f884289e63b430f9c9e98610c1deda964da/src/events.zig#L18

I can access either field of the union

rockorager: if it's an extern union you can access any field of the union

in this case the memory is reinterpreted
