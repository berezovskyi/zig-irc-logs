hmm, is there a way to send an option down in a dependency tree? I have a linear tree of `program -> dep a -> dep b` (i.e. program depends on dep a and dep a depends on dep b)

dep b has a build option (whether or not to link against a certain system library) that I would like to be able to specify when building program

I could change all the build.zigs to propagate the option down, but that seems kind of weird

https://paste.gentoo.zip/9wdbprWr so this could possibly just be a Gentoo issue but does anyone happen to have any clue why valgrind is finding an illegal instruction here?

Hi there! I'm trying to link gtk-4 with zig 0.13, but facing an issue with the includes of the source files. I'm on arch linux and all the header files are installed in /usr/include, but zig build-exe is not finding the files correctly. For example, an include of `gtk/gtk.h` fails, even though the file is in `/usr/include/gtk-4.0/gtk/gtk.h`. If I symlink `gtk-4.0/gtk` to `/usr/include`, it works, but

then of course other includes fail.

This is despite `zig build` showing that the `zig build-exe` command it runs includes `-I /usr/include/gtk-4.0`, so I assume it should look into its child directories.

Ahhh, my issue was *not* a Gentoo issue, but because I've got a CPU that supports AVX512 which valgrind doesn't know. I just used `-Dcpu=x86_64_v3` and it worked
