is there a library for drawing tables in the terminal?

chinmay: i don't know about proper library but if you just want something simple then feel free to take & improve my Table from here: https://git.sr.ht/~netvor/zig-povel/tree/egg/item/src/txt.zig

it's really just computing whitespace for tables like eg. ps(1)

ah the plot thickens on my cancelation + Group (+ thus Select) woes: I just realized the abstract reader/writer interfaces also swallow cancelation and turn it into different error

hmmmmm

well, by that I mean, to be clear, they turn error.Canceled into a different error before forwarding up the callstack

(e.g. error.WriteFailed)

to close the loop on my earlier panic about abstract Io.Reader/Writer interfaces appearing to eat error.Canceled: they save it in the implementation, and it's on the caller (which is probably e.g. a protocol implementation middle-layer) to find the error.Canceled from e.g. "Io.net.Writer.err.?" and re-propagate that instead of error.WriteFailed

How come inside a callconv(.naked) function I can't call regular functions or declare variables?

ii8!~ii8@2001:19f0:7400:144b:1670:baf9:f4b:4508
To provide some context: I'm trying to remove the instructions that save registers from the start of my function, so I tried making it callconv(.naked)

ii8!~ii8@2001:19f0:7400:144b:1670:baf9:f4b:4508
The function is called only by hardware and saving registers is not possible because the stack can't be used at the start

I understand I can't call the naked function from regular zig code, but why can't I call regular zig code from the naked function?
