is anyone aware of a guide on how to compile a raylib.h cIncluded executable game into wasm?

cow_2001: if you don't get an answer on IRC I recommend a post on https://ziggit.dev/

Right now I have a tagged union with an inferred tag type but I want to use std.meta.stringToEnum. Do I just have to create a separate tag type enum and use that for the stringToEnum call?

bwbuhse: you can use @typeInfo to get the tag type

is it possible to do payload capture into a comptime value in a switch? basically I have something like switch (val) { .a, .b => |t| f(t, ...), ... } where t is declared as comptime in f(), which doesn't work (the compiler gives me a "unable to resolve comptime value" error)

maskd: yes: https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Inline-Switch-Prongs

np, it's cool that you independently invented this idea :)
