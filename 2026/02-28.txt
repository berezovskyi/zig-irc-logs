Sivecano: The plan is that the stdlib only has system bindings needed to support itself on said systems. Even now, the std.Io work is clearing out a lot of `std.posix` and `std.os.windows`. Unless the stdlib/compiler has a use-case for fd sealing, you should add those constants into your projects.

toasterking: I think the low level std.os.linux API layer can be complete since Linux is open source and the surface area is relatively small
