For svelte 5, this passes all with one failure that is semantically the same, just a different error text because it's using tsgo instead of tsc

LAC-Tech!~lewis@granite-phrase.bnr.la
nice. I am enjoying the new era of native tooling for JS/TS. I opened a script of mine that was like.. 300 LOC, and I could feel a noticable delay when formatted on save with prettier. replaced it with that oxfmt thing, and it just felt normal

1768273435
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
i'm not a subject matter expert, but as far as I could tell from the conversation, the point of using an LLM is to troll other people by making them review your LLM code, which you do not actually ever look at yourself

1768273476

right, it definitely seems insane to push LLM generated code to a human to review

One aspect of vibe coding and using AI in general is whether you prefer to work on something, or to have the work finished.

Within a few hours, I got 80% of the features I wanted to add done, which is 80% more than the previous two days. TBH I don't know if it can maintain ops since the only (2) channels it is on are either opless or single-handedly held up by someone

I guess most software out there is CRUD and LLMs are good enough at that, that companies will use them for that. I think we need anti bug regulations though. consumers need to be protected from software bugs

1768277346
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
that's an interesting point and I agree with that, I wonder if LLMs will shepherd that era in.. but we'll probably have to suffer through 5-10 years of horrible vulnerabilities

I’ve been finding that AI is very useful to get through low-effort ideas or tools that I want but don’t find engaging to build. for example I like managing my work week in a specific way, so I’ve been having an AI write it for me over the past week or so and actually have something usable already. whereas I’ve started the project multiple times before but never got it to a useful point because I

I feel like, in cases where LLMs seem to "make sense" (as in, seem to produce an acceptable result with less effort), it's really just a symptom of something else gone wrong at a completely different level.

1768320121
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
e.g. where that replaces the output of a human worker... you have to wonder: if the LLM can do it just as well, was the job ever worth doing, or having a human do, or both?

1768320187
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
a whole lot of people in the world work on things that are ultimately pointless from some larger view, or where the quality really doesn't seem to matter in the end

1768320192
reykjalin!7e28cf3a41@user/reykjalin
I’ve had mixed results. LLMs definitely can’t do the job at the same level as people can at this point. They need a lot of hand-holding to get to what I would deem a production ready result. LLMs are incredibly powerful prototyping tools though 

1768320679
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
my primary defensible reason for avoiding LLMs like the plague is: even if they were super-awesome, I don't want my thinking/skillset to atrophy from disuse.  Whatever future may be coming, I want to be one of the few that still knows how to do without them, rather than one of the ones that became dependent on them.

1768321329
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
on a completely unrelated topic: it's fascinating for me to see how the std.Io abstractions are playing out, as a slightly-higher-level and saner abstraction over all the "reasonable" use-cases on "reasonable" extant platforms.  I think a whole lot of important human toil is happening along the way that's making sense of the entire landscape in a way that's somewhat novel.

1768321387
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
and I think a really interesting future outcome, will be when someone writes a new OS kernel (probably in Zig) and shapes the OS's native interfaces to match the landscape that Zig std.Io already discovered, but with fewer hisorical oddities and warts...

1768321730
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
it's also fertile ground to blur the lines and build more unikernel-like things as std.Io abstractions right over the hardware.

1768324399
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
is there some fundamental reason I'm failing to grasp, that there's no `fn concurrent()` in Io.Select()?

1768325263
Smithx10!sid243404@id-243404.helmsley.irccloud.com
I think the LLM models need to either not be central (learn locally from how I work and be free) or the $$$$ required to train / power etc will eventually catch up to them and just make it not profitable.    The saddest thing for me tho.... is we can have Nuclear Power for AI Datacenters and War Ships but not cities or towns since the 80s.  They stopped building them because we *had too much power*,   That's a real travesty.

1768332581
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
one of the things that confused me, though, when thinking in terms of std.Io is an interface.. is using data structures like mutex etc. there's no like io.isSynchronous() or anything afaict; it feels worng to add overhead when unnecessary

1768332596

yes

1768332875
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
what about lockless algorithms adding unnecessary atomic overhead? is there gonna be a std.Io.AtomicValue or something?

1768332899
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
atomics and I/O operations do not need to be aware of each other, precisely because atomics are lock-free and therefore non-blocking

1768334030

just loop from data[0..data.len - 1] instead, then loop again for (0..splat) |_| and write data[data.len - 1] that many times

1768334170

1768335356
ii8!~ii8@2001:19f0:7400:144b:1670:baf9:f4b:4508
Oh so doing `for (data) |d| write(d)...` and then loop `for (0..splat-1) ..` would actually be wrong because the last item shouldn't be written at all if splat is 0?

1768338042
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
looking at it, this approach modeled it more like a 'tail slice' - there's a head that is fixed size and a tail that is dynamically sized. lengths could be stored in both the head or tail and shared

1768338079
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
the Tail is a zero sized struct that uses @fieldParentPtr

1768338128
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
I think I was also exploring storing the length externally, no idea why

1768338146
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
oh I think maybe that was to marry both the obsese slice external length storage with the internal length storage

i don't know if anyone would do it the way i did, but this "inline for" gizmo is great :| http://0x0.st/s/jLEXvTwRF_8Clv-d54g-5Q/P8il.txt

andrewrk: how is this for your use cases https://codeberg.org/tristanpemble/zig-flexible-struct

1768346487
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
not completely done but the fundamental is there.. need to handle auto layout field sorting 

1768346581
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
how does the caller know to use 128?

1768346605
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
I can make calcSize public

1768346612
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
I just picked a random number

1768346612
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
can it be called at compile time?

1768346614
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
yeah

1768346627
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
should work then

1768346637
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
or, I can make one that is initStack or something that returns an array? I don't know how that API would work

1768346653
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
oh that's neat how you did the length thing

1768346661
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
that lets the user control the type as well

1768346701
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
if you want to see my real world use case, it's in my poll branch of zig, impl in lib/std/Io/File/MultiReader.zig, usage in lib/std/Build/Step.zig

1768346728
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
oh, you mean that the length type if configurable so you can do u8 or whatever

1768346730
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
yeah

1768346783
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
it doesn't compile yet sorry

1768346899
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
I would love something like this in the std lib if you're willing to contribute it

1768346941
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
yeah I am

1768346945
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
where should I put it

1768347156
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
feels like it just needs to be in like std.flexible_struct. idk, I'll just PR it and discuss there
