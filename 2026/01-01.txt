JazzJackalope: Vulkanscenegraph is not reachable to me, zig is. If all else fails I can always send an email to zig or ask here ;)

happy new year! what's the policy of runtime asserts VS returning errors in the stdlib, if any? like I feel https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/src/commit/4ad8bc341328e289744a0cc796043d0dd52bb32d/lib/std/os/linux/IoUring.zig#L81 is the same clase of error as all the runtime asserts below it.

LAC-Tech: runtime asserts are for programmer bugs; things that are supposedly impossible to occur. errors are for modeling application state
