Those stack switching trick that Io.async does in order to to that whole async stuff, how well does calling foreign code (i.e. C) play with that? I'm thinking it should be no problem as long as that code is thread safe just in case it's async over threads as well, but aside from that the foreign could *should* be able to be blissfully unaware?

And the whole blocking thing of course, foreign blocks would still be bad

i'm not so sure where i should put my tests because some tests are tied to more than one file, and maybe it'll be easier to just stick them all into src/root.zig or even move them to src/tests.zig?

if i stick them all into src/whatever.zig i can just run "zig test src/whatever.zig" and be done with it
