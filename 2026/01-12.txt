when debugging zig I am not able to see fame variables. I had the lldbinit with all type category enabled. Is that expected

what is #zig's feel on WASM Component Model vs just doing C FFI for WASM module interop? anyone really explored the WACM-with-Zig space much? I am entertaining building out tooling for it for a project I am working on and feel conflicted on whether it (WACM) is just an over engineered mess or actually valuable

I've done a fair amount of wasm stuff and I've never heard of WASM Component Model

it's an IDL/slightly-higher-level ABI for WASM by the ByteCode Alliance people

While iterating a StringHashMapUnmanaged with .iterator(), is the iterator still valid if I delete the entry I just received by key?

if you want to iterate a hash map, I suggest ArrayHashMap

Okay

this map is better at iterating because the keys and values are contiguous in memory, plus you can iterate with an index, and mutate the hash map while iterating

you still have to be careful tho
