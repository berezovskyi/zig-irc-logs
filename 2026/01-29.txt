when I want to pass a single item to a function that expects a many item pointer, is there any reason to use one method over the other here? https://0x0.st/PNGy.zig

slowstatic: it's better to avoid @ptrCast if you can

can the compiler be debugged when your code crashes it?

I'm using Go regularly for a university class the last few weeks, after being more heavily immersed in Zig the last year or so.

For a "simple" language, it is strange how internally inconsistent some aspects of the syntax are compared to Zig. Like struct field assignment with :, range being very magic

I think the strong consistency of symbols and keywords in Zig is pretty nice in comparison
