This is kind of old news, but can someone explain de-genericifying linked lists in 0.15? I don't really understand the motivation

Hi, I'm kinda struggling with the reader interface. I want to use forkpty on a project. that returns me a file descriptor to read it I assume I have to put it in a std.fs.File (.handle = fd) then I can make a reader using file.reader then to read it I assume I do reader.interface.readAlloc(). The problem is there, this last call is hanging. I don't really understand why as the documentation say that

if the buffer is too small or too big it will throw an error. so why would it hang.
