what's your favourite ziglang book?

1767429975
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
think I pretty much just used ziglings and the language and std references

1767430543
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
I just imagine how the language should be ideally, and if it's not the case I edit the compiler

1767430565
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
:P

1767430588
deepend!~deepend@deepend.dev
this is why none of the examples I copy paste compile..

1767430899
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
pretty much, but it's a worthy sacrifice to make 1.0 better

1767430917
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
even if I emitted many 4 letter words while porting from 0.14 to 0.15

1767430939
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
It builds character! or something

1767430944
deepend!~deepend@deepend.dev
I do agree improving std is worth breaking stuff I am mostly joking

1767430947
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
0.16 breaks quite a bit of APIs 😬

1767430956
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
Exciting!

1767430958
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
but in exchange you get async/await/cancel

1767430961
deepend!~deepend@deepend.dev
but as a noob it can be confusing what version some code is written for without a zig.zon file

1767430974
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
yeah

1767430981
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
definitely have to look at post dates

1767431078
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
maybe we should just provide official upstream guides for various things with automated tests so they always work

1767431148
deepend!~deepend@deepend.dev
why is it std.Io but std.fs ? I keep wanting to write std.io.<foo>

1767431161
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
Io is a type

1767431199
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
because there are std.Io implementations

1767431220
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
std.Io.Threaded for example, and std.Io.Evented

1767431287
deepend!~deepend@deepend.dev
I think I understand but still tempting to write std.io.File not std.Io.File

1767431289
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
heh, right, since modules are structs, so technically everything is a type, you can create an Io, you're probably not creating a std.fs (and if you are, I have questions!)

1767431292
deepend!~deepend@deepend.dev
maybe just need to spend more time with it

1767431338
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
well, the folks writing the standard library are "creating std.fs"... I'll stop digging myself into a hole now heh

1767431415
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
andrewrk: Any idea how far out 0.16 is yet?

1767431518
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
Affliction: right about now is when we would usually start the release process, but since master branch is unstable due to being in the middle of async I/O resurrection, I think it would be appropriate to postpone the release. I'm going to chat with the team about this in our next meeting

1767431539
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
fair enough

1767431578
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/issues/30150 it would be good to finish this issue before the tag

1767431747
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
audit std.posix (aiming to delete all functions) oh dear, I took a dependency on that recently :V

1767431815
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
But, I can't argue with the linked ticket either

1767431880
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
deepend: Welcome to zig. Things change, you want to argue against it, then you think about it and end up supporting it, heh.

1767431901
deepend!~deepend@deepend.dev
how would os specific stuff work? like Ive been messing around with terminal things, tcsetattr and whatnot

1767431912
deepend!~deepend@deepend.dev
was surprised to see lots of terminal stuff in std.Progress

1767431919
deepend!~deepend@deepend.dev
but not like a std.Terminal

1767431937
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
I think there was talk about a Terminal abstraction...

1767431938
deepend!~deepend@deepend.dev
ya Affliction I am impressed with the rate of changes honestly

1767431950
deepend!~deepend@deepend.dev
I'm just staying on dev branch at this point and rolling with it

1767431964
deepend!~deepend@deepend.dev
tho I did get a microzig build working which I think is on 0.15 something

1767431996
deepend!~deepend@deepend.dev
I was really impressed with the terminal output for the build tree stuff when first toying with zig

1767431999
cow_2001!~username@user/cow-2001/x-5712099
when's it getting ISOed?

1767431999
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
used to do that, now I'm sticking with stable. Bit easier to reason about, especially during times of major change, like writergate and async

1767432003
deepend!~deepend@deepend.dev
and the error output stuff is great so far

1767432034
cow_2001!~username@user/cow-2001/x-5712099
Affliction: reading Pedro's book right now

1767432037
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
Affliction: out of curiosity what is the dependency on std.posix that you took on?

1767432049
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
andrewrk: Strangely, terminal stuff!

1767432126
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
specifically raw input with a timeout

1767432140
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
doesn't quite look like Terminal has that yet

1767432163
deepend!~deepend@deepend.dev
yeah I was literally just figuring out raw input to get immediate keypress events instead of waiting for newline

1767432182
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
(Though, this'll probably only ever be used on linux, so it's probably not too painful to replace with std.os.linux if that's out of scope for Terminal)

1767432221
deepend!~deepend@deepend.dev
right like in python i would have: os, termios, fcntl as separate imports

1767432270
deepend!~deepend@deepend.dev
and then windows always gets weird ofc, I think there are two different ways to do raw input there

1767432292
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
I remember windows' console stuff being completely different

1767432299
deepend!~deepend@deepend.dev
way different

1767432310
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
so yeah, a cross platform API would have to be a bit more abstract than what std.posix did anyway

1767432755
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
which functions in particular?

1767433049
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
I _think_ just tcgetattr, tcsetattr, and read(). Requirements were along the lines of "Grab bytes (if any), parse bytes into slightly higher level keycodes, block for at most 100 msec"

1767433105
deepend!~deepend@deepend.dev
https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/termios.3.html

1767433113
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
for the concrete answer, I'd have to get back to you

1767433124
deepend!~deepend@deepend.dev
yeah the term control stuff: get/set attrs for sure

1767433212
deepend!~deepend@deepend.dev
I think the windows equivalent is like GetConsoleMode and SetConsoleMode

1767433217
deepend!~deepend@deepend.dev
but I think there's more than that to it

1767433240
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
wow these functions have a lot of possible error codes

1767433267
deepend!~deepend@deepend.dev
terminal stuff is so weird cause of all the really old machines that are still supported

1767433269
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
naturally raw stdin, but async would be half of the story

1767433278
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
indeed

1767433327
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
turning the bytestream into higher level events, my code for that was pretty nasty, and specific to the keys I care about, so something more general there would be a bit nicer, but not required

1767433362
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
oh I misread the man page

1767461242
mimivalsi!~mimivalsi@user/MimiValsi
I have a tiny buffer: var tmp: [4]u8, in which I want to reused several times. I know it will aleays use the 4 spaces but even so, is it good behavior to call: tmp = undefined before using it or it doesn't matter?

1767461266
mimivalsi!~mimivalsi@user/MimiValsi
reuse* always*

1767462063
slowstatic!~slowstati@user/slowstatic
setting tmp to undefined would help prevent bugs while you're building out your code

1767462212
slowstatic!~slowstati@user/slowstatic
detect* bugs

1767463141
mimivalsi!~mimivalsi@user/MimiValsi
Seems fair. Thx

IstiCusi!~phonon@user/IstiCusi
I just wanted to tell you, that this is one of the smartest moves, to avoid github because of its ice relation .. totally agree ... I know that I invest in the correct language

1767463568
IstiCusi!~phonon@user/IstiCusi
we need tools to automatize the move to codeberg .. I will directly also move all my little repos there

1767463704
slowstatic!~slowstati@user/slowstatic
big agree the move to codeberg is badass

1767463980
IstiCusi!~phonon@user/IstiCusi
slowstatic: great guys .. .antifascistic 

1767464025
IstiCusi!~phonon@user/IstiCusi
I am from Austria and my family split in the 30s in two parts.... one in resistance against NS, the other ones real nazis ... we Austrians know the smell too good

1767469180
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
IstiCusi: such things are off topic here please

1767469195
IstiCusi!~phonon@user/IstiCusi
as offtopic as on the zig news page ?

1767469215
IstiCusi!~phonon@user/IstiCusi
but ok

1767469220
IstiCusi!~phonon@user/IstiCusi
:)

tranzystorekk!86175ff574@voidlinux/maintainer/tranzystorekk
hm, is there a "placeholder" value for the build.zig.zon fingerprint field that can be copied over to bootstrapped projects? at the firefly zero project we're pondering what to use to make the bootstrap projects work OOTB

1767469946
IstiCusi!~phonon@user/IstiCusi
Sivecano10: maybe with hashes of zeros

1767470004
IstiCusi!~phonon@user/IstiCusi
tranzystorekk: Are zero hashes working in this case and replaced ?

1767470043
tranzystorekk!86175ff574@voidlinux/maintainer/tranzystorekk
seems randomly generating the "random" part of the fp works for now

1767470062
IstiCusi!~phonon@user/IstiCusi
tranzystorekk:great
