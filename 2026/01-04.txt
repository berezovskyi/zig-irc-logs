andrewrk: are there any plans to reimplement the unicode support for format alignment?

no, zig std lib formatted printing is for byte buffers, not unicode-aware buffers

Well, I've been having fun going through the zigling exercises using the v0.15.1 branch. I learned a couple of features I haven't learned before and a programming pattern with defer.

Good solid and free learning material.

unfortunately I'm not sure anyone who works on ziglings is in this channel to accept your words of appreciation

I just wanted to openly share about my positive experiences, especially from how popular it is. Much of my learning was from having a question in my head from trying to solve a problem and doing a quick search which most of the time was solved by an AI answer. By comparison, using Ziglings felt like a nice learning course with a straight trajectory to learning everything.

I just figured out how to override the allocator for a dynamically loaded shared object file written in C :D.

it's way easier than I'd feared.

Speaking of learning resources, etc. I was thinking about how nice it would be to have some sort of migration guide to either automate or suggest boilerplate snippets to aid in migrating from Zig versions. Should I get the time to gain such experience, I would be happy to help in the endeavour.

akiva: yeah that would be really nice. the hare project set a nice example for this that would be good to follow

andrewrk: Oh, that's one of the only projects of Drew's I haven't kept up with. I will take a look into that. I'll update with progress as it happens. :)
