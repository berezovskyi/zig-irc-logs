reading the comment and understand it are two different things. "a zig package can expose multiple modules", but the bit where the name of the module is actually specificied is inside the imports field of addExecutable

ok for name clashes

I don't understand your messages grammatically

andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
I suggest using complete sentences

"ok the reason modules have two names is because the name used for imports is allowed to differ to prevent name clashes"

1769472896
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
yes that's correct

andrewrk: Is it okay if I write a new target proposal for a device that isn't released yet? Amazon (probably TI in this case) leaked a new TI graphing calculator called the TI-84 Evo. https://ceme.tech/t20852

oh wow.  std.io.Dir.readFileAllocOption's return type is !(if (optional_sentinel) |s| [:s]align(alignment.toByteUnits()) u8 else []align(alignment.toByteUnits()) u8)

not magic in the usual "blackbox" sense, but magic in the wow sense

how to check if a struct type has function of particular signature?  lsay i have `pub const MainFn = *const fn (SubcommandContext) anyerror!u8;` and want to check if `T` contains such function under the name `main()`

1769542793
netvor!~netvor@2a00:ca8:a1f:cd0:2176:fe83:9e12:6e87
assuming function is declaration, i can't find anything that gives me details about a declaration

1769542873
netvor!~netvor@2a00:ca8:a1f:cd0:2176:fe83:9e12:6e87
i mean there's `@typeInfo(T).@"struct".decls` but that only gives me name of the decl

andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
netvor: generally, the zig way is to use duck typing instead

1769542900
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
let the compiler do that work

1769542921
netvor!~netvor@2a00:ca8:a1f:cd0:2176:fe83:9e12:6e87
you mean just call the function and see?

1769542924
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
yep

1769542929
netvor!~netvor@2a00:ca8:a1f:cd0:2176:fe83:9e12:6e87
ok thanks :)

i might have been overthinking it .. but i was only after giving a "good" @compileError  message .. but really just checking @hasDecl will be enough

1769543099
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
it's hard to give a better compile error message for type mismatching than the compiler

Hi. I wanted start learning Zig. My question is do I need to install LLVM as well? Thank you so much in advance for your help.

1769543374
Sivecano70!~Sivecano@user/Sivecano
llvm comes with the compiler

1769543447
ic3dc0r3!~igloo@user/ic3dc0r3
Oh! I see! This means that Zig is tied with LLVM? My apologies for any stupid questions!

what OS are you on?

I am using Ubuntu Linux. Thank you so much andrewrk. I will make sure to read the documentation!

andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
I recommend to download 0.15.2 from the download page. just untar it and you're all set

1769543765
Sivecano70!~Sivecano@user/Sivecano
I mean, you either use a package manager (in which case you should never have to worry about dependencies)

1769543765
Sivecano70!~Sivecano@user/Sivecano
or get the portable executable from ziglang.org (in which case it comes with all the needed dependencies included)

wow zig.guide has been updated, that's great

netvor!~netvor@2a00:ca8:a1f:cd0:2176:fe83:9e12:6e87
also the zig-book looks much better than the last time i checked.  good stuff.

I forgot how much I miss custom allocators on a per function call/collection basis. this is nice. I either want a fancy GC or this, everything inbetween is uncanny valley.
