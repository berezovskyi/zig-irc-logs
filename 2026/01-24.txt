i'm reading Crafting Interpreters and there's a point where they set the Pratt parser table.  it is C, so the syntax is ParseRule rules[] = { [TOKEN_LEFT_PAREN] = {grouping, NULL, PREC_NONE}, ... }; and i wonder if there's something equivalent i could do in zig?  the author is using enum values to initialise specific locations in an array without hardcoding the indexes
