Is it bad to liberally use @branchHint(.cold) for things like branches that are used in initialization then never again or in branches that will cause the program to exit?

But yeah, EnumArray for when you have values for every enum field, EnumMap for when some are optional, EnumSet for "present/not present" or "true/false" for each enum field.

I have an interesting question. I'm attempting to compile ghostty from their git snapshot (not what they recommend I know) and zig build is unable to find system libraries during the compilation process (I'm using the opensuse built version of zig). However, if I use the static binary from the ziglang website there are no issues finding system libraries and compiling successfully. I've been playing around with the opensuse zig build as it appears it might be

 related to how opensuse builds zig but so far no success. Any idea what could cause this? Are their build options that have to be set that opensuse is missing?
