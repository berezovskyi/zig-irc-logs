WOOO!  thanks.  somehow the leaking's gone, but the code is weird

cow_2001!~username@user/cow-2001/x-5712099
i used a Value union with a field .val_obj holding an Obj struct with a field .data holding an ObjData union with a field .obj_string holding a [:0]u8

hello can you read me?

1770813130
Naxlavun!~Naxlavun@user/Naxlavun
yes

1770813138
shadertheory!~textual@user/shadertheory
i have been invited by, i believe, potential

1770813156
shadertheory!~textual@user/shadertheory
zig and rust are my most proficient languages

1770813222
Naxlavun!~Naxlavun@user/Naxlavun
i know a few programming languages but i'm not proficient in in any

1770813230
shadertheory!~textual@user/shadertheory
that is okay, it is a journey

1770813237
Naxlavun!~Naxlavun@user/Naxlavun
yeah

1770813260
shadertheory!~textual@user/shadertheory
i had half a decade of core experience before rust atleast, and 3 years of rust before zig

1770813295
shadertheory!~textual@user/shadertheory
I wish I could ziggify the world, not oxidize! Zig is soooo good to work with

1770813336
Naxlavun!~Naxlavun@user/Naxlavun
ikr. zig is my first choice for most tasks

1770813338
Amun-Ra!~amun-ra@retro.rocks
I have only A2 in ziglish

1770813368
Naxlavun!~Naxlavun@user/Naxlavun
what's A2?

1770813376
shadertheory!~textual@user/shadertheory
thats what im thinking :P

1770813391
Amun-Ra!~amun-ra@retro.rocks
you know, A2 level like in human language learning ;)

1770813405
shadertheory!~textual@user/shadertheory
I thought you meant paper sizing *sob*

1770813409
Amun-Ra!~amun-ra@retro.rocks
hehe :P

1770813420
Sivecano!~Sivecano@user/Sivecano
I appreciate zig's ability to integrate with the existing ecosystem over rust's seeming struggle to do so

1770813441
Amun-Ra!~amun-ra@retro.rocks
I use mostly nim, python and zig

1770813450
shadertheory!~textual@user/shadertheory
i am twitch streamer by same username i am making a crypto game but i will not talk about crypto here or much because its a genuine passion project for long haul

1770813455
Amun-Ra!~amun-ra@retro.rocks
(and C)

1770813485
Naxlavun!~Naxlavun@user/Naxlavun
good luck shadertheory

1770813489
shadertheory!~textual@user/shadertheory
thank you

1770813513
shadertheory!~textual@user/shadertheory
but really, it is a geospatial (real map) realtime hacking game, thats the idea

1770813532
shadertheory!~textual@user/shadertheory
i used zig for making a language for this project

1770813602
shadertheory!~textual@user/shadertheory
Sivecano, apologies for 4 in a row,  I agree with you-- I think it has to do with native C interop and much closer to C way of thinking

1770813697
Sivecano!~Sivecano@user/Sivecano
it also doesn't have the same strict runtime requirements as what rust assumes. 

1770813718
shadertheory!~textual@user/shadertheory
yes! that is the thing, people assume as a system language rust has no runtime. but it does, and it requires it

1770813721
Sivecano!~Sivecano@user/Sivecano
though I do find myself wishing for a native abi. 

1770813728
Naxlavun!~Naxlavun@user/Naxlavun
i gotta make an irc client. i don't like any of the clients i used so far

1770813741
shadertheory!~textual@user/shadertheory
make it in Zig :P

1770813772

shadertheory: I mean, it doesn't have a runtime in the same way that java does. but the assumptions of safe rust are very complicated and sometimes hard to meet from within an unsafe block. 

1770813817
Naxlavun!~Naxlavun@user/Naxlavun
planning on making it in C

1770813889
shadertheory!~textual@user/shadertheory
awh jeez rick thats a lot of join messages

check how to hide them in your irc client

Nevermind, I decided to make the iterators use direct reads and writes over Reader and Writer wrappers.
