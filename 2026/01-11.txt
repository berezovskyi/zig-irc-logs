cow_2001: I think you need only 1 buffer in the top of your main function for that

you know, when it comes down to it.. I like the things this language makes me think about more than the things other languages make me think about

should i pass the writer to all functions that will print with it like with allocators?

cow_2001: yeah I'm pretty sure taking std.Io as a parameter to all your functions doing io is the intended pattern

cow_2001!~username@user/cow-2001/x-5712099
okay, that works.  thank you!

cow_2001: yeah make the writer early on like in main and then pass `stdout: *Io.Writer` as nedded. don't forget to flush at the very end

When we pass a tuple for std.debug.print for exemple. We can fetch the values using @field(args, field.name). But is it possible to write or copy on those args? What would be the correct way?

I tried once but got an error saying that I cannot assign to constant. Which is fair...

how do i read a whole file into memory?  i don't see anything in the std documentation that sticks out at me for doing that

1768164032
cow_2001!~username@user/cow-2001/x-5712099
maybe i could just read into buffer, then extend an arraylist

appendRemaining?

cow_2001: check out std.Io.Reader

allocRemaining with limit = .unlimited iirc

hmm!  thank you!

cow_2001: If it's a "I have a filename and I just want this thing in memory", std.fs.Dir has convenience functions that open, read, and close files, .readFile(), .readFileAlloc(), .readFileAllocOptions()

naturally in zig style, you're encouraged to use Io.Reader in "library-ish" code for reusability

and, the above applies to that.
