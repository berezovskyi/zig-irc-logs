so, is it a lost cause to try to keep my project up-to-date with zig master? specifically I have some dependencies that either (1) are lagging behind master or worse (2) seem to only track the latest release. I'm up for submitting PRs to resolve these (I only have a handful of dependencies) but I'm just curious if there's a general best practice here

ezzieyguywuf: https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/ "In general, tagged releases are more practical for projects that have dependencies and benefit from stability, while development builds are for people who want to help participate in the development of the Zig project."

if you want productivity, choose latest tagged release. if you want to help shape the future of zig, choose master branch

I don want to help participate

btw, you mentioned the io_uring branch the last time I was in here, any estimate on when that may land in master? I'm trying to decide if I should wait before mutzing around with io_uring stuff in zig.

unsure whether that will land in 0.16.0 release or not. it's almost there but has some issues to be worked out and not strictly needed for the tag

cow_2001: cool, I'm gonna take a look. I tried doing jlox in Zig but my code got really... uh... bad at some point and I was very lost and gave up, I need to go try again some time

btw, Codeberg seems to not have your gpg key (at least I think that's what it means?)

it's not free of bugs

bwbuhse: i think the problem is that the primary email used on this account (or commits?) is different from the primary email in the key, although i've added more emails to the list

1770070287

it's a pain

I'm really enjoying low-level programming in zig. I just made an inotify wrapper and it's pretty great :D
