a if statements needs to be a boolean, but can I use: if (!true) ?

In Go I make methods: if c.IsAlive() {}; if !c.IsAlive() {}

I am looking at making an app using Zig and SDL that could be used on Linux and iOS. It seems like the graphical user interface aspect would be possible, but I am thinking the network and file I/O aspects might be more complicated. For example, I guess the Zig std http client would not work on iOS? Is this idea infeasible?

why would it not work on iOS? zig code is extremely portable

the limiting factors I think would be the stability of zig's standard library (there are regular breaking changes) and the robustness of std.http (it's new code and has not passed a security audit yet)

andrewrk, thanks. That is very encouraging to hear. I have not done a ton of iOS development, but I just thought iOS code might require using it's own APIs for network and file access. Does Zig use those APIs under the hood? Same for Android?

In the ast some Ast.Node.Tags say "sub_range_list"  (eg struct_init). What is that referring to?

martin2020, for all intents and purposes, ios is nearly identical to macos

nvm, i see it uses tree.extraData() to pull the other nodes
