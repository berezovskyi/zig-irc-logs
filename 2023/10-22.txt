I thought I saw a runtime memoization function somewhere in zig, but can't remember where. Does anything like that exist, or did I imagine it?

so if you have a unit test that relies on a c library, how do you tell zig to link to that library when you just run that test?

ok so I worked you can pass a so file as an argument

but it would be cool to annotate the test somehow so it knows what it needs to run

what is a `build.zig` if not annotations of what libraries something needs

so like if you have a test 'x' that requires a specific .so library, you can ensure that it will run just with zig test 'file-containing-x' by adding it as dependOn? or something else?

jacobly!~jacob@2600:1f18:1fb:6300:1d52:d474:9e12:db33
it would by `zig build my-custom-step-name` to run the test
