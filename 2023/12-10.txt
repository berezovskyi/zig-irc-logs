Hello! I was wondering if it's possible to select which module (already imported, as it's not possible to import modules with a non litteral string) to run, for instance I have d1, d2, ... to d25 imported, is there a way to use a function in a module with only an int variable that loops from 1 to 25 ? Not sure if I'm clear enough

Sh4d1, comptime or runtime int?

jacobly: can be both, it's just a for range loop for 1 to 25

`inline for (1..26) |i| _ = @field(@This(), std.fmt.comptimePrint("d{d}", .{i}));`

oh @This works here too, wonderful! Thanks a lot!

any reference to the namespace containing the module decls will work

you could also store the modules in an array and iterate them

even better :D great!

jacobly: is it possible to detect at comptime that a module does not have a field X and use a field Y instead? 

1702206719
jacobly!~jacob@ec2-3-210-217-213.compute-1.amazonaws.com
A field or a decl?

1702206733
Sh4d1!uid259210@id-259210.uxbridge.irccloud.com
a function in my case 

1702206760
jacobly!~jacob@ec2-3-210-217-213.compute-1.amazonaws.com
`if (@hasDecl(@import("module name"), "decl name"))`

simple as that (I definitely ought to read all the builtins at some point!), thanks again!

Hello, everyone. I'm running into an issue where zig does not appear to detect the libc include paths, specifically `/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu', on Debian unstable correctly. Here is a reproduction: <https://pastebin.com/4fQMSZAX>. If anyone knows what the problem might be, help is much appreciated. :)

is there an idea of when is v0.12 expected? I've been bashing my head against the http server; it's quite painful to try to use :(

grayhatter: you may get better results with <https://github.com/zigzap/zap>

I disagree with a lot of the decisions zigzap has made

Hi all, I'm experiencing a weird issue where I have to clear the cache before I run zig build or it errors out with "error: Unexpected". Has anyone come across this / do we know of a solution?  I'm running 0.12.0-dev.1808+69195d0cd via a nix flake but I doubt that matters here.

I came across this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76206472/how-to-change-the-local-cache-directory-for-the-zig-build-system but my cache folder is local.

sheelpatel: maybe worth a github issue?

cancername it just occured to me that iCloud syncing might be interfering, so I'm disabling that to see if it makes a difference.

Yup it looks like that was itÂ :/

:) glad it got resolved

Issue solved. The problem was a hack in libc6-dev-i386 erroneously putting the files into /usr/include and not a subdirectory of it.
