I noticed something while trying to update an existing build.zig to the master version of Zig

1691049488
plumeus!~plumeus@user/plumeus
does addCSourceFile have no way to specify flags anymore?

1691049496
plumeus!~plumeus@user/plumeus
And why? addCSourceFiles still seems to

1691050933
squeek502!~squeek502@user/squeek502
plumeus, it now takes a CSourceFile struct which has the flags as a field: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/e85a46cb84c80a7a97316f066b77e45649ce97fb/lib/std/Build/Step/Compile.zig#L220-L230

oh wait, I didn't notice that

I'm trying to debug a deadlock in a single threaded binary, are there any docs for atomic ordering, or any suggested reading?

1691080401
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
grayhatter, that should be very straightforward, all you need to do is attach a debugger and print a stack trace, and the deadlock should be obvious

1691082351
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
My question was more for general interest because I don't know enough. With the default stacktrace I was able to find the deadlock pretty easily, GPA alloc and free, one from the main thread, the other from a signal (which has the same thread, so it looks like a deadlock to std.atomic)

grayhatter: signal handling and atomics are not really related

1691082759
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
well... they can be somewhat related like in this specific example. But my interest extends beyond just fixing the bug. I've already replaced the GPA with an Arena to kick the can down the road... but also, not because of the bug I don't know what unordered means for an atomic load/store, and I would like to.

ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
grayhatter: For that I think your best bet is to refer to the definitions in the C11/C++11 memory model

also https://www.llvm.org/docs/Atomics.html

ifreund: <3 thank you

no problem!

companion_cube!~simon@user/companion-cube
https://marabos.nl/atomics/ is a good book, too

1691082997
companion_cube!~simon@user/companion-cube
it's basically the same memory model (except it doesn't have one of the orderings C++ hasâ€¦ but no one implements)

can the zig build system help me pull in external dependencies for my project yet? examples of dependencies my project needs are: murmur3, gmp, libuv, curl, aes_siv, ed25519, etc.

1691088831
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
matthew-levan, yes, here is an example of pulling in ffmpeg: https://github.com/andrewrk/groovebasin/blob/zig-pkg/build.zig

1691088841
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
here is an example of pulling in SDL2: https://github.com/MasonRemaley/2Pew/blob/main/build.zig

matthew-levan!~matthew-l@2600:2b00:a908:c600:49ba:19ad:47b0:2bdb
great, thank you! i'm going to run a skunkworks operation to replace our current build system (bazel ...) in our project https://github.com/urbit/vere

1691088939
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
cool

1691088963
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
matthew-levan, caveat, it does require porting the dependency to the zig build system

1691089041
matthew-levan!~matthew-l@2600:2b00:a908:c600:49ba:19ad:47b0:2bdb
by that you mean i can't use zig to execute the project's officially supported build commands?

1691089063
matthew-levan!~matthew-l@2600:2b00:a908:c600:49ba:19ad:47b0:2bdb
(i expected that, if so)

any plans to be able to pull external deps from the web? see an example of us doing that here: https://github.com/urbit/vere/blob/aca51716170f45daa23e9637a9aeeeeff8360c2a/bazel/third_party/gmp/gmp.BUILD#L8 and https://github.com/urbit/vere/blob/aca51716170f45daa23e9637a9aeeeeff8360c2a/WORKSPACE.bazel#L166

the examples that I gave you pull do that. you can fetch from arbitrary URLs
