When a file is used as a struct like "Rect.zig" how can I mark it as "extern" or "packed"?

I can define a struct inside Rect.zig like `pub const Rect = packed struct {...` but then all the namespaces use "Rect.Rect"

you can't mark a file as extern as packed

just do `const Rect = @import("rect.zig").Rect;`

"There is a difference between a function body and a function pointer. Function bodies are comptime-only types while function Pointers may be runtime-known.

" - I don't quite get this. aren't all functions known at comptime? IIRC you can't dynamically create them

LACampbell, i believe it is a roundabout way of saying that you cannot create a function pointer to a compile time only function that is used at runtime.

after all, if it was never compiled into the executable, there's no function to call for the function pointer.

oh! thanks braewoods that makes perfect sense
