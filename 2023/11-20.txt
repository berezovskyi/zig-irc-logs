what is the recommended way to organize tests? I have a file that I create a module out of. that file imports definitions from various other files. I want to make it so that testing the single module file also performs tests from the imported individual files.

sudw1n: usually people do `test { _ = import1; _ = import2; }` where import1 and import2 themselves have test blocks (and that's the presented way in langref, https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.11.0/#Nested-Container-Tests), but I prefer to do ` comptime { if (@import("builtin").is_test) { _ = import1; _ = import2; } }` instead, so that test count is not skewed.
