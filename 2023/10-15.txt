I'm on my way now.. building gmp from source is going to be a doozy. There isn't a way to run configure scripts is there?

That'll do.

if all its doing is converting is some .h.in to .h there might be a way to skip it entirely too

I will check, it's a fairly extensive library with many subpackages.

matthew-levan!~matthew@ip-50-5-118-215.dynamic.fuse.net
Lots of .m4 files, Makeasm.am, Makefile.am, Makefile.in, config.in files...

All together though, the INSTALL instructions just say to run ./configure && make && make check.

Probably need this resolved before I can get this to work easily: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/17463

if you care about being able to build on the incredibly popular operating system *retching sounds* microsoft windows, you will probably need to replace the upstream build system

1697331276
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
also for a generally better out-of-the-box experience so that zig is the only build dependency needed (this is not universally feasible, though, especially for projects to use external tools to generate asm or whatever). also obviously a lot more work for dubious reward if you are only planning to build on a small subset of systems

the best spot for docs is that file, doc comments on functions, autodoc guides, or writing blog posts and sharing them

how does zig emit debug information for llvm

torque: I don't need to support Windows thankfully, but I do need to compile repositories that include *.asm files already in it. I tried using the `step.addAssemblyFile()` function but I haven't gotten it to work yet.

matthew-levan!~matthew@ip-50-5-118-215.dynamic.fuse.net
GMP, the repository I've been working on building with Zig, has *.asm files included in it.

ok, stupid question: how do you add a signed integer and an unsigned one (also of differing widths)?

matthew-levan, the ffmpeg example I linked you also compiles assembly files with nasm

1697398541
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
soupladler, you need to coerce your integers to a wider type to do the addition
