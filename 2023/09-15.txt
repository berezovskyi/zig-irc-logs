the real reason to use zig is because you like the letter z

andrewrk: I'll be traveling alone and don't know anyone there, and I don't know much japanese; so I assume I'll be getting by on whoever is around that speaks english and a translate app

1694740663
Albright!~Albright@2001:19f0:8001:ca4:aa21:3244:cbda:342b
That can get you fairly far but my enjoyment of Japan increased the more I could understand what was happening around me, personally.

andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
daurnimator, I suggest to learn these words: sumimasen, onegaishimas, hai, arigatou gozaimasu, ohayou gozaimas, connichiwa, conbonwa. those will get you quite far

1694740889
daurnimator!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
andrewrk: I know at least those

1694740920

I did take japanese for ~7 years back in school. But I probably couldn't put a sentence together longer than "hi my name is .... "

1694740924
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
7 years!!

1694740956
daurnimator!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
I can even remember ~60% of the hiragana and katakana characters..... so I can sound out some things

1694740969
daurnimator!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
but it's a completely atrophied skill

1694740979
daurnimator!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
and I was never very good in the first place

Learn the characters for "man" and "woman" so you know which bathroom to go into

1694741524
Albright!~Albright@2001:19f0:8001:ca4:aa21:3244:cbda:342b
Well, hopefully you remember those ones from seven years of study too.

1694741675
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
that's pointless because there are icons

1694742001
Albright!~Albright@2001:19f0:8001:ca4:aa21:3244:cbda:342b
Sometimes. I've been the guy to have to accompany someone to the bathrooms in a restaurant and show them which one to use.

1694742542

ahh

copygirl: I think Zig's compilation time will approve greately once its dependence on LLVM is finally gone.

remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@KD106137200105.ppp-bb.dion.ne.jp
daurnimator: Ah, in that case, there's plenty to do. Most people will indeed use their iPhone or Android phone with Google Translate on it to talk to foreigners, because English proficiency here is among the lowest on the planet.

1694755022
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@KD106137200105.ppp-bb.dion.ne.jp
andrewrk: "sumimasen, onegaishimas, hai, arigatou gozaimasu, ohayou gozaimas, connichiwa, conbonwa. those will get you quite far" None of them are helpful when asking for directions to physical locations though.

Albright: "Learn the characters for "man" and "woman" so you know which bathroom to go into" 男 and 女 respectively. But most of the time, toilets tend to be color coded in blue/cyan or red/pink, in touristy areas they usually include "men" and "women" in addition to "男" and "女", and the women's toilet is generally queued up with all women too.

1694755221
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@KD106137200105.ppp-bb.dion.ne.jp
And if you're still unsure, then there's a wheelchair toilet, which both genders can use.

1694755261
Albright!~Albright@2001:19f0:8001:ca4:aa21:3244:cbda:342b
I guess if we're talking about major train stations and stuff

1694755268
Albright!~Albright@2001:19f0:8001:ca4:aa21:3244:cbda:342b
I'm talking about like izakaya

Ah, like that.

The places you go and the guy behind the counter somehow says "irasshaimase" in two syllables

1694755333
Albright!~Albright@2001:19f0:8001:ca4:aa21:3244:cbda:342b
They probably won't have a wheelchair bathroom

1694755376
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@KD106137200105.ppp-bb.dion.ne.jp
How do you say "いらっしゃいませ" in 2 syllables? It's 6!

1694755432
Albright!~Albright@2001:19f0:8001:ca4:aa21:3244:cbda:342b
It's like "sshaissee" or something. It's crazy

1694755460
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@KD106137200105.ppp-bb.dion.ne.jp
Sounds like he's trying to say a bad word in German to you.

1694755473
Albright!~Albright@2001:19f0:8001:ca4:aa21:3244:cbda:342b
Ha. Well, maybe.

1694755521
remiliascarlet!~remiliasc@KD106137200105.ppp-bb.dion.ne.jp
It's common to not be able to catch all syllables in a language you don't know, so I can understand that.

what's a good place to put zig libraries, ~/.local/lib/zig/ ?

1694814888
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
Seems nice

1694814969
diachiara!~diachiara@user/diachiara
As good as any

1694814970
GreaseMonkey!greaser@user/greasemonkey
i suspect that a convention of something like ~/.local/lib/zig/0.12.0/somelib/build.zig might work, although realistically the best way to do it would be via environment variables

1694814995
GreaseMonkey!greaser@user/greasemonkey
...erm, 0.12 would be a better way to specify it in the path than 0.12.0

1694815044
GreaseMonkey!greaser@user/greasemonkey
zig executables on the other hand is a mostly solved problem: zig build install -p ~/.local

1694815716
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
GreaseMonkey, your question lacks context

1694815729
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
putting zig libraries somewhere isn't really a thing. can you explain more?

1694817456
GreaseMonkey!greaser@user/greasemonkey
i'm thinking from the context of how C-compatible libraries are installed on a Linux system

1694817476
GreaseMonkey!greaser@user/greasemonkey
more specifically development packages

1694817494
GreaseMonkey!greaser@user/greasemonkey
(that is, you get headers and possibly static libraries)

1694817510
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
in that case put them in the same place you would put C libraries

1694817525
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
there is no reason to namespace them with "zig"

1694817546
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
dynamically shared libraries already have a versioning system

1694817569
GreaseMonkey!greaser@user/greasemonkey
if it's C-compatible and spits out a .so and/or .a then yeah, ~/.local/lib/ would make perfect sense

1694817661
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
agreed
