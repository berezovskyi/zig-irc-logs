trying to recall, does the zig std lib support an HTTPS server out of the box or do i need to use something like nginx?

if it's the former i'll try to rework it so it can be run asynchronously w/o depending on async/await being reinstated, and if it's the latter i'll just go with nginx

it looks like the tls code is currently commented in std/http/Server.zig? https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/master/lib/std/http/Server.zig#L33-L34

I used caddy to set up some basic reverse proxy stuff recently and it was pretty nice

GreaseMonkey, i generally recommend using FastCGI or similar for web applications. native HTTP tends to have issues in deployments beyond a single domain from what i've seen.

GreaseMonkey, using nginx or caddy for https is recommended anyway because then you can hook up automatic lets encrypt renewal

Hey what's the state of the 0.11.0 release? asking because I have a patch for the build system that I think should go out with the release, hopefully it's not too late

mattikus, you might want to wait a couple hours because I'm in the process of merging https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/16446 with a bunch of changes on top of it

Should this work `print("{[val]any:[fill]>[width]}")`? I know the fill part doesn't work right now, but I would have expected it to.

Asking to see if this should be considered a bug or expected behavior.

mattnite, I think of it more like a tower defense game where the PRs coming in are the invading forces and setting up turrets is delegating tasks, upgrading towers is mentoring contributors

Hello, any of you people learned zig as your first language, if yes, how was your experience and what problems you faced?
