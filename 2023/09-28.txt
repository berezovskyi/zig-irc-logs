i'm trying to integrate zig testing into my ide and I need `zig test` to output results in a structured way (json, xml or something else) so that I could parse it and display in UI accordingly

lawrence-laz!~llaz@88-119-26-117.static.zebra.lt
is there a way to do this?

you can use your own test runner modified off of the builtin one, but atm there's not way to make the builtin one output structured data like you describe

Is there any way to send a cookie with a request using the std library's http client?

Hi everyone. So I've been bringing-up newer Zig versions onto illumos (open source fork of Solaris), and I'm trying to get a clean test run following the recommendations in the contributing doc. Many tests appear to pass, but I also have quite a lot of things failing. One such thing I see is a failure to execute the "blocks" test case (many things fails to exec, I'm just picking this at random). Looking at that file it's a statically

linked executable, which exec(2) quickly kills probably because of the missing interpreter entry. The source specifies two targets: one for linux and one for mac. So I'm not sure why the testing system is trying to execute this binary.

rzezeski, the build system does not try to guess whether a binary will execute on the system; instead it tries it and then handles the error code appropriately. this enables use cases such as binfmt_misc, wine installed as a program loader, etc.

here is where it checks the error code: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/c4ad6be0023ad351a59f53cab7c59fccecb6f82d/lib/std/Build/Step/Run.zig#L667

what error code is exec(2) returning?
