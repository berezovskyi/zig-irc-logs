I mean you could trivially write your own expectEqual function that has semantics you like

torque!~tachyon@user/torque
it's not like functions in the testing namespace are special

I'm not a fan of the way the std expectEqual works either

1694223518
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
but I also think it's really gross "yoda condition" style to have the expected value come first anyway

thinking out loud... has anyone ever written a test where the expected value isn't compile time known?

grayhatter: sure, thats quite common for simple fuzz tests of a data structure or whatever

Hi, is there a way to immediately show test output while a test is running? It seems like `zig build test` waits until the test is over to print the error

how do I make a module for internal use? there isn't a lot of information about it. right now I think I have to `createModule` in `build.zig`, and the `zig init-lib` in `libs/mymod/`.

fengshaun: is the code for the module in your source tree, or in a different/unconnected directory?

1694296639
fengshaun!~fengshaun@71-17-154-190.regn.hsdb.sasknet.sk.ca
in the source tree

would something like this work for you? https://github.com/GrayHatter/hsh/blob/main/build.zig#L16-L18

if that's what you're already doing, `zig build` will compile and include it for you

see also the addModule() a few lines down on 27

thanks

is the `src/log.zig` file under any specific directory or `project_root/src/log.zig`?

fengshaun!~fengshaun@71-17-154-190.regn.hsdb.sasknet.sk.ca
I also noticed zig build ignores other files in the tree if they're not mentioned in build.zig

1694296961
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
zig will only build source files it needs to. If they're not included with @import(), or mentioned in the build.zig. there's no reason zig would want or need to compile them. 

1694296999
fengshaun!~fengshaun@71-17-154-190.regn.hsdb.sasknet.sk.ca
makes sense, I'll try a few things and see what I get

1694297003
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
no, it's just a file at src/log.zig which could live anywhere the build.zig file can look https://github.com/GrayHatter/hsh/blob/main/src/log.zig

1694297045
fengshaun!~fengshaun@71-17-154-190.regn.hsdb.sasknet.sk.ca
yea, I'm looking around, it's very helpful! thanks!

1694297061
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I'd be willing to bet ../other_repo/src/log.zig would work as well, but I've never tested that :)

1694297141
fengshaun!~fengshaun@71-17-154-190.regn.hsdb.sasknet.sk.ca
that's what I'm gonna play around, see how far I can divide up stuff into files
