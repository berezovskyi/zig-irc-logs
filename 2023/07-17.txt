Happy to be of service, gauze! I was actually looking to browse through the channel's history before asking questions while writing some toy Zig code and ended up updating the code of the logger to build with the new version of Zig. If I won't have the bandwidth to keep it running, my updates for Zig 0.10 were upstreamed to

Levy[m] thanks, what do you mean by the milestone? Just going through https://github.com/ziglang/zig/milestone/17? Seems a wee bit... overwhelming to me :)

driib, https://github.com/marler8997/zig-unofficial-releases has a pretty good list of changes since 0.10

I don't know if there's another source besides reading the git log, which.... well, a ton of work has gone into 0.11, so that's probably kind of overwhelming

That's actually exactly what I was looking for, thank you!

I have a static library that I wrote in Zig: https://github.com/monomycelium/tm1637. Do you know how I can use it in another Zig project (made using `zig init-exe`), preferably using `build.zig.zon`?

andrewrk, i'm sad to say that https://andrewkelley.me/temp/static-window9 no longer runs on archlinux :(

its a very cool idea though. the idea of a completely system independent graphical executable is a dream of mine too.

Hello, folks. Zig doesn't work on macOS 10.14 anymore?

https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/14405 is the relevant issue, I think.

Also, will the generic linux binary on the downloads page work for, say, an Ubuntu VM as is (I presume so)? I might (if macOS 10.14 is indeed not supported) go with a small VM (so binary builds, not source).

Anybody?

The generic Linux binary has never failed for me except when trying to detect the system-installed libcs on distros like NixOS.

On Linux, Zig only needs itself and /proc/self/exe as far as stuff on file-system is concerned. The rest are pure syscalls which are available regardless of the used distro. You can trivially run zig it in initrd with busybox or so.

I also tested it on Android via termux (aarch64), works perfectly. My preferred choice for small utilities, because it's so easy to self-host.

Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong here? I'm pretty sure 'example.Packet.Header' has a member named 'size'. I can even use @offsetOf with it. https://godbolt.org/z/T8Tq4nx6e

you can't access fields from the namespace

jacobly0!~jacob@2600:1f18:1fb:6300:1d52:d474:9e12:db33
The easiest thing to do is `const hdr_sz = @sizeOf(@TypeOf(self.header.size));`
