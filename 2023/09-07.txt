gpanders: Hmm, I feel like that's cleaner than the idiomatic way. (Only exception being it relies on a std function.)

the example pasted above does declare the type redundantly. but `var buffer = [_]u8{0} ** 128;` does still take some dang finger gymnastics to type

How do I easily figure out the inferred error set a function returns?

1694066873
fengshaun!~fengshaun@71-17-154-190.regn.hsdb.sasknet.sk.ca
e.g. std.http.Server.Response.Writer.writeAll

I think you can do something like `catch |err| switch (err)` and the compiler will complain about all switch branches you've omitted

Will @compileLog work to print the full error union type?

I wonder, Zig has been drastically different between every single 0.x release. Is this intended to solidify post 1.0 just like Go and C? Or will it keep changing all the time like Rust and C++? I personally think the former is true, considering that Zig and Go both target C devs, whereas Rust and Carbon both target C++ devs.

torque, thanks, will try that.

copygirl, I didn't know about @compileLog, not sure but I'll give that a try

wow, @compileLog works! I don't even need to write compilable code for it to work. That's amazing, it's writing out the entire return value for the function call

too bad it doesn't recognize error union aliases like http.Server.WriteError

remiliascarlet: definitely the former

Hmm I guess tests don't reset global memory for each test?

Anyone know why the zig.vim plugin erases so much on the c-a-w move compared to when doing the same operation on a C file?
