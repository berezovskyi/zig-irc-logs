ekaitz, torque: also, line numbers change with incremental compilation when code above changes, but relative AST node offsets do not

the system is designed to minimize recompilation as much as possible. however, none of this work is enabled yet because it's not done

how do i enable generating documentation from `build.zig`?

sudw1n!~pratik@user/sudw1n
I know there's the option `generated_docs` in `LibExeObjStep` but I can't figure out what to do with it. And it seems like the `emit_docs` boolean has also been removed?

sudw1n: I believe you call Compile.getEmittedDocs() to get a LazyPath and then install that using Build.installDirectory() and passing the lazy path as the source_dir

ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
or do whatever else you want with the lazy path

ifreund: so it did work, in that the generated docs for `src/main.zig` were generated but `main.zig` also does `@import("lib.zig")` and the documentation from that file aren't generated in the output.

man, the documentation for "Root Source File" is just a TODO rn.

ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
root source file is just whatever you pass to `zig build-exe` or whatever

I'm pretty out of touch with how complete/functional the documentation generation is

I know that it can't handle non-trivial comptime logic

Hello folks. I couldn't find anywhere what :0 means in the syntax: host = host[1.. :0]; Could somebody point me in the right direction?

ah, nevermind. sentinel-terminated slice, of course.
