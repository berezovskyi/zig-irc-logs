I just started learning zig it's very interesting!

Maybe because Im new but it feels like a cross between Rust and Typescript

@andrewrk: I have been watching lots of your talks great stuff.

daurnimator: If it helps, you can keep an eye on the milestones on Github (god, why Github?). Unlike Rust, in the case of Zig, release happens as soon as a green bar hits 100%. https://github.com/ziglang/zig/milestones

remiliascarlet: not at all. things regularly move between milestones, and not everything is of the same effort/difficulty.

the bar fills up and then a bell goes ding ding ding and out pops a steaming hot fresh zig out of the oven.

is it possible to use zig from C++?

1695289444
dolololadidi!~dolololad@82.102.18.214
I mean make some zig lib, generate some C++ header, link it to my c++ code?

1695289472
dolololadidi!~dolololad@82.102.18.214
Or does it only work with extern C?

oh found an article

dolololadidi!~dolololad@82.102.18.214
seems like it's about C not C++

pretty sure you can only export C ABI stuff from Zig, not C++

dolololadidi: You can use C from Zig, not the other way around. As for C++, dunno.

dolololadidi: you can export symbols from zig; and you can export C headers (or is that unavailable at the moment?). You can't export C++ for now..... but C++ *can* import both C, as well as link against arbitrary symbols. so there are routes forward

one thing I considered doing at one point was a zig function that takes a zig type, and spits out C/C++/D/whatever language "headers".... and then when writing the zig library, have it embed it's own headers. With PIE you could even make it so if you `exec` the library you'd get a header spat out!

It's something I don't have the use case for right now; but as soon as I do..... :)
