andrewrk: I've got 1 night in tokyo next week; any suggestions on what to do?

daurnimator, yeah! only 1 night huh? do you like to eat meat?

daurnimator: Depends on what you like to do. Tokyo has lots to offer, but if by "night" you literally mean from 0:00 to 6:00, then I'm afraid there's very few things to do.

hey guys, I'm wondering about the state of cross-platform GUI library support for zig; I'm looking to put a very simple desktop application together using zig and trying to work out which library would be a good choice, e.g., qt, wxwidgets et al. Anybody have any experience in this regard?

I wasn't able to find many that were native zig when I last looked, but if you already have a toolkit you know and like, you should be able to use it pretty simply if they have a c api

thanks, I found this blog post and I'm tempted to try the approach: https://mitchellh.com/writing/zig-and-swiftui

daurnimator, find an all you can eat yakiniku restaurant where you order dishes at your table on a tablet. you pick stuff from the menu and then it shows up raw at your table, you grill it right there and dip it in sauce then eat it immediately. it's incredible. then maybe go to karaoke late night with a friend if you can

there's lots of stuff you can do at night because sometimes people get stuck after the trains stop and they just hang out in tokyo all night. for example I think spa world or whatever it's called is open 24 hours

re: cross platform UI tool kits... I wonder if anyone has made a library that lets you communicate with the UI via an IPC ABI boundary rather than a C++ API boundary

Like X11?

1694714844
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
yeah like that. except the protocol is not very useful or cross-platform

Probably worth looking into the work Arcan is doing in general

1694714926
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
Although it is a lua (iirc) interface to C, there are probably quite a few good ideas

1694714928
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
if I go to their home page and there's not a screenshot on Windows, macOS, and Linux on the home page, it's probably not what I'm looking for

Their very old, discontinued AWB desktop was quite inspiring: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O40cPUqLbU - this was found when I was trying to look for something that could represent the power of the cli in a gui

1694715110
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
But in general all of their stuff is interesting, and the youtube channel has more, for those who want to explore

hey all - I am a C, JS, and Python dev. Considering taknig the plunge to learn Rust, but then I heard about Zig. I know this room is probably a lil biased towards Zig, but could you guys give me a quick breakdown/comparison of the pros and cons

I like Zig's metaprogramming.

1694719770
copygirl!~koppeh@copy.mcft.net
And what bothered me about Rust was that dependencies took up GBs of space on disk.

Zig appears to compile significantly faster.

1694719835
copygirl!~koppeh@copy.mcft.net
Zig is not as mature. I've run into computer crashes a couple of times.
