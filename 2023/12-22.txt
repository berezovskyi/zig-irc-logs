Is anyone familiar with zap? I'm trying to give it a shot but on build it just complains that it can't find facil.io after following the instructions in README.md. http://paste.debian.net/1301837/

still learning about how things work in a broader context, so any recommended resources would be much appreciated

Is there a way to partially apply the pointer to `ops` in my toy VM example here (it's short and basic zig): https://gist.github.com/tsujp/70ec52b7bac095725209a12f856895d9

I'm trying to initialise a sparse comptime array and passing a pointer to the array each and every time isn't that fun

you could use a for loop over the other parameters since that initialization happens at comptime

also in defOp you should just be able to do `arr[@intFromEnum(op)] = inst;`, no need for the explicit dereference
