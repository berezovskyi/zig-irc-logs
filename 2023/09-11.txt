the wasmer guy kramering into the zig issue tracker and yelling about his bespoke wasm extension not being supported and that the zig community would benefit from it while offering very little money compared to the effort

Isn't this the WASM extension that adds fork to WASM? I've heard... a lot of pushback about this

1694445056
drakonis!drakonis@user/drakonis
yes

1694445085
drakonis!drakonis@user/drakonis
from wasmer of getting banned from the bytecode alliance fame

cr1901!~cr1901@2601:8d:8600:226:b558:6b98:9244:2fab
Yea, I've heard not good things about working for him

citatation on any of that?

1694447495
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
I know nothing about the people involved, but "port bad legacy POSIX API design to WASM" doesn't seem like the best path forward to me

1694448649
drakonis!drakonis@user/drakonis
yes well

1694448661
drakonis!drakonis@user/drakonis
many citations and quotes

1694448708
drakonis!drakonis@user/drakonis
though the worst part of this, is both the framing and implication that it is irrelevant that the code is maintained or not

1694448732
drakonis!drakonis@user/drakonis
like it only exists for a marketing bullet point to justify wasmer

1694457113
nektro!~nektro@75-164-190-81.ptld.qwest.net
posting a bounty on a feature request that hasnt been approved also seems shady

1694457146
nektro!~nektro@75-164-190-81.ptld.qwest.net
and through a bot/platform not previously used by the owning org

well, dropped my hot take comment on the WASIX issue: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/17115#issuecomment-1714433655

1694462625
drakonis!drakonis@user/drakonis
ifreund: that's an incredibly mild take

1694462684
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
drakonis: ok, lukewarm take then, I don't have the personal experience to back up anything hotter

I recall reading that 3 months ago

1694462766
drakonis!drakonis@user/drakonis
also the post about working at wasmer

1694462822
drakonis!drakonis@user/drakonis
i genuinely dont like the whole thing because its someone's bespoke extension to wasi because they're banned from interacting with the rest of the wasm world because they're terrible people

wasmer is trying to attach itself into zig for brownie points

1694462884
drakonis!drakonis@user/drakonis
see also wasmer 3.0

1694463017

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37015901 also this

1694463120
drakonis!drakonis@user/drakonis
ifreund: to be fair, the biggest sin here is that wasmer is a vc backed startup trying to take over the wasm ecosystem with a series of hare brained projects and utterly failing at it

1694463724
drakonis!drakonis@user/drakonis
there's also sockpuppeting on hn and trying to trademark webassembly lol

1694463734
drakonis!drakonis@user/drakonis
the more i look into it, the more i remember how terrible this is

1694465042
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
yeah, It definitely smells like shit

1694465062
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
I don't need to air out other people's dirty laundry on the issue tracker though

lampilelo!~user@user/lampilelo
how can I link an external static library to a zig project?

1694465172
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
lampilelo: are you using build.zig or the zig build-exe CLI?

1694465219
lampilelo!~user@user/lampilelo
build.zig

1694465353
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
lampilelo: passing the path to your static library to std.Build.Step.Compile.addObjectFile() should do the trick then

1694465427
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
I reckon the standard library could use an addStaticLibrary() alias of that function, the name is kinda misleading but it does what you want

1694465637
lampilelo!~user@user/lampilelo
i did addObjectFile(), but it ended up with linker errors

1694465646
lampilelo!~user@user/lampilelo
but i found a solution

1694465657
lampilelo!~user@user/lampilelo
addLibraryPath and linkSystemLibrary

1694465706
lampilelo!~user@user/lampilelo
or not

1694465743
lampilelo!~user@user/lampilelo
still throws linker errors

1694465901
lampilelo!~user@user/lampilelo
i'm trying to build a c++ file and link it to a library written in c++ but i kinda have no idea what i'm doing

1694466487

ifreund: the sad thing is seeing people defend it because of the big payout
