ah nevermind, it's here, just under "Practical DOD" ( NOT department of defense, but rather data orientated design) https://guide.handmade-seattle.com/c/2021/practical-dod/

Hi, I am new to zig and I want to create a application that can make request to certain https websites. But it seems as if Zig only supports TLS1.3 at the moment which significantly limits websites I can contact. Is there any library I can use so I can get more broad TLS support so I can connect to more websites?

does it not support 1.2?  https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/master/lib/std/crypto/tls.zig#L56

kling4: what versions do you *need* to support? If you're looking for it to be easy I remember seeing an example for importing the c curl lib. If that doesn't work, I think I'd consider import openssl (or a API compatable alternitive)... or I might break the bad rule of "don't roll your own crypto" and I'd try to implement the lower versions myself, depending on how much security I actually needed
