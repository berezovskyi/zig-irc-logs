Exa: compilation happens *before* linking

yeah, basically if you want to support multiple versions of a library, you have to either shell out to something like pkgconfig or reproduce its logic (or both use pkgconfig and also back it up with a bunch of platform-specific logic, which is the way a lot of cmake library detection code works)

pkgconfig should be reasonably "portable" for sane platforms. it doesn't work well on e.g. windows where applications normally bundle specific versions of libraries for everything that isn't windows api

my question would be, what is your goal for supporting multiple versions of a system library?

one of zig's nicer features is how easy it makes static compilation and compiling C/C++ libraries directly. depending on what platforms you need to support, compiling and statically linking your deps will make it simpler and give you less edge cases to deal with (supporting multiple versions of things can be hard)

motiejus: you're having a good amount of experience building stuff with go, right?

Random thought just popped in my head.

In unused code paths, compile errors could be hiding. Would it be possible / sensible to print a warning when that is detected during compilation?

Not the compile errors, but just unused functions and such that the compiler skips.
