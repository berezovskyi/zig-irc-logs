also, can you unwrap an optional at compile time?

Hello peeps, so I'm just starting out on my zig journey ... worked my way through ziglings to start getting familiar with the language it self.

Now I would like to tackle something a bit bigger, but I'm a bit confused about how I should go about using 3rd party libraries (eg. zig-clap or zig-cli)

looks like thing have changed quite a bit recently eg. addPackage -> addModule etc but I can't seem to make it work! I've also failed to use the 0.11 package manager so far (not all libs support this yet)

While I understand this is likely not possible, I figured I'd ask anyway: I'm gonna try to use Zig as a scripting language, and I'll be needing to look at what other scripts one depends on.

Theoretically that would mean reading out what @imports the file has, see if they refer to relative paths. Is there a way to do that, or should I be considering parsing the file for import statements?
