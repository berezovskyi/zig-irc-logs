companion_cube: everything counts actual seconds, the difference is how they each define a second

1700957786
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
almost everything assumes 1 second is 1/86400th of a rotation of earth, where TAI uses the SI definition previously fixed as the frequency of caesium, (but maybe one day stronitum?) and then TAI defines a new epoch to use as well

grayhatter: obviously a real second is the SI one

1700958072
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
companion_cube: yeah, obviously, how could anyone ever think any different

1700958075
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
:<

1700958076
companion_cube!~simon@user/companion-cube
So UTC counts fake seconds

1700958083
companion_cube!~simon@user/companion-cube
Well yeah

1700958098
companion_cube!~simon@user/companion-cube
The scientific definition is the correct one

1700958105
companion_cube!~simon@user/companion-cube
Just like for meters 

1700958107

SI second is the time length of 9192631770 (55)Cs state transitions

1700958250
companion_cube!~simon@user/companion-cube
Yeah, it's an actually defined value, makes sense that it doesn't have leap seconds too

1700958312
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
the SI definition, is just that, a definition. Something people can agree on. Before it was based on caesium, the SI definition was based on the shadow of the sun on a number drawn on the ground.

1700958398
companion_cube!~simon@user/companion-cube
Sure but it's a immutable, precise measurement, whereas earth rotation isn't used in physics, and will slowly change over time, correct? :) 

1700958436
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
the SI definition isn't better than any other definition. Using the TAI definition, given enough time it'll be high noon (when the sun is overhead) at 1:20 AM. Which seems undesirable to me

1700958495
companion_cube!~simon@user/companion-cube
It's better because it's connected to the rest of physics :) 

1700958499
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
no, the rotation of earth won't change given time. Every time the earth rotates, it'll rotate exactly once.

1700958525
companion_cube!~simon@user/companion-cube
Just like the meter is better than the mile, while we're on non controversial topics 

1700958535
companion_cube!~simon@user/companion-cube
Well it can slow down I think? 

1700958577
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
if you're not modelling planck time, you're doing it wrong /s

1700958593
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
So, if you define 1 second as 1/86400 earth rotations, then 1 earth-rotation-second is as useful as an SI second. because it'll never change. 

1700958635
companion_cube!~simon@user/companion-cube
But then everything else will change :D. Even the speed of light! 

1700958640
companion_cube!~simon@user/companion-cube
That's not great

1700958647
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
If you're trying to plan some event, and you want to do it when it's warm outside, you can say every day at 2pm. If you use TAI, it'll eventually be cold at 2pm right? so TAI is obivously worse

1700958692
companion_cube!~simon@user/companion-cube
Man I respect your game ðŸ˜‚

1700958829
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
definition $A isn't better than definition $B, unless you have some reason it's better. If you're trying measure the distance to some star, I'd probably want to use the SI definition. If you're trying to tell someone when some what time of day a comment was made on a social media site, I'd say unix & posix definition is better.

1700958997
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
if you're trying to know when to turn on or off some motor for [amount of thrust], neither is too helpful, and defining a second as [number of clock ticks on this CPU for each known temprature] is much better.

1700959009
companion_cube!~simon@user/companion-cube
Ok, more seriously, I'd say the SI def is better as a scientific foundation and for engineering (eg for GPS tech). Day to day UTC is fine, but it's clearly to be defined in terms of the other

1700959089
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
You know that UTC isn't different than TAI right? It's TAI plus an offset so that noon still feels like noon to humans. 

1700959093
companion_cube!~simon@user/companion-cube
If you want to talk about drift in UTC you need to express that in another notion of time that's more invariants 

1700959096
companion_cube!~simon@user/companion-cube
-s

1700959128
companion_cube!~simon@user/companion-cube
Ah, so why do we need the 84000th def at all? 

1700959146
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
companion_cube: why do we need months? or years?

1700959165
companion_cube!~simon@user/companion-cube
Convenience! 

1700959175
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
or french?

1700959185
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
we should all just speak english, and use TAI

1700959217
companion_cube!~simon@user/companion-cube
Sorry, French is the metric language, it'd be the one standardized :) 

1700959223
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
right... that's my point. Something isn't better because it has higher precision. It's better if it can be used

1700959250
companion_cube!~simon@user/companion-cube
I was tongue in cheek earlier, but I do maintain that one is more foundational

1700959386
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
one has higher precision, sure... but if I ask you how many days ago something was, and you give me the count of caesium transitions instead, you're the problem

1700959387
companion_cube!~simon@user/companion-cube
I need to vent after being exposed to American units for too long, pardon me :ðŸ™ƒ 

1700959420

Well there wouldn't be any significant difference at a human scale 

1700959460

Sometimes in SF you find "kiloseconds" and "megaseconds" and that's so lovely! 

1700963444
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
unfortunately a second is a delta, not an absolute measurement, so it has reduced usefulness without an accompanying epoch

1700963496
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
I did recently compute that my grandmother is over 2.9 gigaseconds old, however. years is such a boring time scale

1700967925
companion_cube!~simon@user/companion-cube
very random, but I'm watching https://youtu.be/dEIsJPpCZYg?feature=shared&t=1116 and I can't understand why the optimization would be performed

1700967932
companion_cube!~simon@user/companion-cube
like `rotate(&v, &v)`

1700967951
companion_cube!~simon@user/companion-cube
surely these are all in SSA form at that point, so there's actually not the same `v` twice, right??

1700968108
companion_cube!~simon@user/companion-cube
seems like a good spec should be formal, at this point, there's no way prose is precise enough

is it possible to install zig on linux, without XCode or any Apple dev ID, and build a cross platform Hello World program that runs on MacOS?   I know cross platform is a selling feature of Zig, but I don't know the list of dependencies required yet

has anyone used the TLS lib? is it totally broken?

1701031539
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
ahh, #14172 yeah, the TLS lib doesn't work on even some 1.3 servers... 

1701032007
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
do any maintainers have an opinion on what zig's support for TLS looks like? would you be willing/able to write one? I need to add both tls 1.2 support, as well as client cert support to a project, and would be happy to ship it upstream as well. Follow up question, does anyone know how to submit security comments?
