All right, I've set up an instance of a logger on my VPS and will monitor its stability over the next week.

You can check the log dumps at https://github.com/berezovskyi/zig-irc-logs/tree/live/2023

If all goes well, I will look into setting up the frontend.

I also have an unrelated question: is there a built-in flag for conditional compilation of code for specific Zig versions? I was playing around with setting up a test matrix with different versions of Zig https://github.com/berezovskyi/zig-irc-logger/actions/runs/5570214989 and thought it would be nice to try updating the code to compile for Zig

0.11, but if I do that, the code would stop working under 0.10.

I watched Andrew's talk where he introduced conditional compilation concept w/o a preprocessor but I think an example was around the OS arch or a custom flag in the build.zig. Or what's the common way of dealing with breaking changes between minor 0.x releases in Zig? P.S. I picked Zig this weekend for the first time, sorry if it's a well-known

question.

I think the common way is generally just to upgrade to the newer syntax/features when backwards compatibility breaks

projects that want to be stable generally target the latest versioned release and update the codebase when a new release comes out

but a lot of stuff also just more or less tracks master

I don't know that there are any projects that are really trying to support multiple zig versions at the moment, or if it's even particularly feasible. Even with conditional compilation, there are still syntax changes happening that can prevent the compiler from getting that far into the compilation process

Ha, syntax changes, I didn't think that far :) Makes sense then that not many projects do conditional compilation on the Zig version. If I may, one more question: is there a draft page of the release notes for the next version of Zig? So that I can figure out what is going to break in the next stable release?

best to compile with master and check the milestone

drlib, thanks for taking the time to set up the logger. i was just thinking yesterday about how it would be great to have access to this channel's history.
