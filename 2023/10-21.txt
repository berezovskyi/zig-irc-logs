anyone have any clues why gpa -> ArenaAllocator would do this sometimes, but not always? https://gist.github.com/GrayHatter/98093e9e75c8766a3a543ae437f4ade8

unrelated question... is it normal for zig-cache to be 13G?

re zig-cache yes it doesnt clear itself, u have to periodically delete it urself

so, I have a GPA, which never crashes, and a arena allocator with that GPA as it's child alloc. It doesn't crash in one use case on my local machine, does crash on my server, and crashes in both for another function... are there any bugs, or nuance to the arena allocator I've forgotten?

grayhatter, do you have some code that reproduces the crash consistently? if so, posting that would likely be helpful

but that's currently way too much of a compilicated setup process :D

the file in the stack trace gist crashes consistantly

I have another that'll only crash on one system, but not another :/

nektro: Is there a way to "intelligently" clear the cache?

nektro!~nektro@71-34-68-44.ptld.qwest.net
i believe there's an issue open exploring that

1697919655
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
Fair enough

noncredibly by building in a tmpfs perhaps

cargo/rust have a much more severe case of this issue

nektro: In a sense the most "intelligent" would probably be a case of determining the content of the cache given a current build and removing everything else, which is likely not too far from just removing the cache and rebuilding (zig build --cache-only?) in terms of time taken

what in the actual fuck

so, the arena allocator, won't segv if line 101 exists

but if I comment it out, it will segv

1697920202
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
the segv is on line 89
