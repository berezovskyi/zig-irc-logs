> wasmer is trying to attach itself into zig for brownie points -- This is what it feels like to me, which makes me anxious about the attention that issue thread is going to attract. If it was my repo, I'd "minimize" many of the comments as off topic, and point out the first part of the discussion is if zig wants to include this or if it's better suited to a fork, (and that everything else is offtopic

until that's decided)

I'll also quote what my friend just told me to emphasize what it feels like  > The OP looks very slimy, and that's enough for me.

dunno, as a relatively passive observer it would appear to me someone is abusing the somewhat laissez-faire spirit of the issue board. ^

I feel like I am torturing myself with zig (first take ever :P). I was experimentind with zap examples and I came across something i tought was simple, i need to convert a number back to a string.

If on line 11, i give an int it runs "ok", if I use my variable (that takes the parameter from the url), I get: "unable to resolve comptime value".

What should I do so it would be "able"?

Lionyx: I believe you're looking for bufPrint() or allocPrint() rather than comptimePrint()

1694556777
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
comptimePrint() only works for comptime-known values as the name suggests

makes sense, I gues I got lost and inverted what I wanted in the process

1694556859
Lionyx!~user@187.23.175.49
so, there's no macro or standard function just to String(123) to "123" magic in Zic right?

Lionyx: the functions I suggested are the standard way to do it

the thing you're probably not used to is having to thing about where the memory for the new string comes from

1694556966
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
in Zig, memory is manually managed so you must be explict about what memory you would like to use for the new string

Hmmm i see it.
