I will also need to interface with libusb, anyone here ever done that in zig?

Hmm, does zig's std.os.windows provide some definitions somewhere for BACKGROUND_BLUE/BACKGROUND_RED/etc constants as defined in <WinCon.h> (<Windows.h>)? https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/console-screen-buffers#character-attributes I've been searching for it but unsucessful in finding this.

Ah hm, it seems like a bunch of hassle just for these constants -- SetConsoleTextAttribute appears to be defined in windows.zig, which is 99% of what I need these for. I think I will just duplicate them from consoleapi2.h where they're defined, since I don't want to @cImport here or somehow up with a libc/CRT dependency just for these parts.

messing w/ 32-bit MIPS on an (emulated) N64, and it turns out that std.fmt.bufPrint breaks if it actually has to put padding characters in

...ok, found the problem, "baseline" has stuff that a MIPS III CPU does not, using "mips3" as the CPU type instead makes it behave fine
