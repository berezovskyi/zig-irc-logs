anyone see zls crashing in nvim on write when the zig.vim autoformat changes the file?

I've been away from zig for a little while. I guess there are a bunch of changes to modules/packages/build.zig. I've mostly got that, but I could use a good example of translateC.

It is a little strange to be that b.addTranslateC(.{...}).addModule("") creates a module, but then later lib.addModule(...) adds that module as a dependency.

But I guess that is how it works.

It doesn't seem like you can specify cflags, just macros.

I guess I've mostly got it, but I'd love to see a best practices example...I'm just following the types and source comments until it seems to work.

FYI I used to just run translateC manually, but if I'm going to try to create a local module (package?) and depend on that from another project, I guess it should be in build.zig, assuming I'm not patching the output.

Also do point me to the latest docs. I've seen various stuff searching the web, but it hard to tell what is old and what is new.

re cflags/macros, I get it that zig probably doesn't need the other cflags when translating, but then you have to filter out the macros rather that just using cflags defined for actual c code. I think the docs say (said) at one point to make sure you use the same cflags in translatec as in the rest of your project.

I guess that begs the question of how to keep it straight when combining packages. Again, best practices?

I'm willing to learn this stuff, but I find it depressing that Zig is pursuing yet another packages system. I wish something like nix would subsume all these language specific systems. What if I want haskell and C and nix and racket and ... all in my package?

Anyway, let me know if you have any pointers on my brain dump. Thanks.
