LACampbell, all functions may be comptime known, but which function a function pointer is actually pointing to may only be runtime known (whereas which function a non-pointer value refers to must be comptime known)

const std = @import("std"); // The type 'type' does not support array initialization syntax

bad source location, u have a bug somewhere else

nektro!~nektro@71-34-68-44.ptld.qwest.net
file is correct though

1697598545
LACampbell!~lewis@granite-phrase.bnr.la
so it's somewhere in that file, but not that point of it? OK thanks

oh I found it, i had the type of a tuple as ".{ Foo, Bar}" but it should have been "struct {Foo, Bar }"

really appreciate the tip nektro god knows how long I would have spent

hey can you define functions within test blocks?

1697625366
nektro!~nektro@71-34-68-44.ptld.qwest.net
you can define a struct in a function and define a function within that struct

test blocks are secretly functions, and this is the general way to define functions inside other functions

oh ok that's cool actually

What is the correct way to cast a data ptr from a c callback into a "zig"ptr?  https://zig.godbolt.org/z/Ej7ThY4KE

1697654373
frmdstryr!~jrm@172.56.216.254
It says use @alignCast, when I try that it says use @ptrCast.

1697654408
frmdstryr!~jrm@172.56.216.254
The only way I can get it to work is using just casting to an int and back.

1697655427
jcmoyer!~jcmoyer@user/jcmoyer
frmdstryr: you need both casts, e.g. @ptrCast(@alignCast(data.?))

Ah, nice. Thanks!

I want to share a seed RNG with a bunch of tests. Is my SeededTest struct on the right path? I can't figure out how a 'test' can access self. https://github.com/LAC-Tech/laterbase/blob/master/src/sim.zig#L12

LACampbell, what do you mean by "self"?

1697660228
LACampbell!~lewis@granite-phrase.bnr.la
andrewrk: well I want a bunch of tests that can access the same RNG, so I can replay them. I guess in "SeededTests", self would have rng

LACampbell, are you asking how to use global variables?
