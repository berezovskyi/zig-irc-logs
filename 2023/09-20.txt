Evening folks. Been trying out Zig and the more I use it the more I enjoy the language. Am at the point of where I want to help Zig in what ways I can. So, if you've stuff you want to throw at a dev unfamiliar with building compiler's; I'm game.

missionz3r0: there is a page in the wiki about contributing, worth giving that a read https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Contributing

Yup. Looking over the contributor friendly issues now. Thinking to tackle some of the doc related tickets. Many of them have been bumped down release milestones since they were made in 2018 for 0.4.0

missionz3r0: Improving or expanding the docs, especially with example code would be **so** helpful to people like me! If you were able to improve them, that'd be so awesome!

I've been struggling with them a bit myself. Is why those issues are calling to me.

Think #1576, documentation for extern/export is what I'll go for. I target wasm frequently so can share some of the experiences I've had in that realm.

Then work from the older issues forward.

andrewrk: I saw LLVM17 support got merged. Will that be in zig 0.11.1?

1695187639
daurnimator!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
I assume not...

1695187641
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
certainly not

1695187657
daurnimator!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
but then obligatory follow up question: how long till 0.12.0?

1695187684
daurnimator!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
(i.e. how long do I have to carry the LLVM16 dependency for)

1695187700
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
relatively short, only a few more weeks

1695187740
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
maybe as soon as LLVM tags 17.0.5

1695187767
daurnimator!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
that sounds ambitious! I was thinking async/await might take some large amount of time

Yo! Question for stupid people: That new compiler written in Zig is the Frontend, right? The backend is and will always be LLVM?

1695241462
nektro!~nektro@75-164-190-81.ptld.qwest.net
the backend is llvm for now and will be available for release modes for the forseeable future but there's also work to have native backends in zig as well

1695241493
jemius!~imperator@2001:9e8:32f9:c700:6e1d:c684:8a35:43d5
cool

1695241546
nektro!~nektro@75-164-190-81.ptld.qwest.net
the first ones (x86_64, maybe arm64) should be testable around 0.13 if i had to take a guess

1695241628
nektro!~nektro@75-164-190-81.ptld.qwest.net
and will be the default for debug mode once ready, which will vastly improve compile times during development

daurnimator: New LLVM version does not equate to new Zig version. Back in Zig 0.10.1, Andrew said that 0.11.0 will co-insite with LLVM 16's release, and it still took a few months longer until 0.11.0 got released. So the basic rule of thumb is, 0.11.1 or 0.12.0 will release when it's ready for release.
