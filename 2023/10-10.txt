does anyone already know approximately when std.StringArrayHashMap becomes faster than std.ArrayList + for * std.mem.eql?

Does anyonw recognize which tool was used to benchmark https://github.com/ziglang/zig/commit/8f2f12f94080ede762df4a5018249160eedc7f09 ?

I'm taking my first stab at using a build.zig.zon file.  I'd like to fetch a tarball of source code for a C++ project, extract it, and then start integrating it's sources into my project. Do dependencies in the build.zig.zon have to unpack into a directory that contains a build.zig file?

that's the one. Andrew, would you be so kind to rename it at least for the sake of package distributors?

anyways, I just finished a nixpkg "ready be upstreamed", just to find out it's already packaged! My personal preference to rename this tool still holds, though I will not hold it against you if you decide to leave it be :)

https://gist.github.com/LAC-Tech/825582250be3a3a017ffd9e2d4bae123 the struct Internal requires Node, and the struct Node requires internal. What's the solution to this? Not sure if there's some mechanism for forward declarations or mutually recursive type defs.

LACampbell, looks like issue 12325

1696972776
LACampbell!~lewis@granite-phrase.bnr.la
ah. might be easier to define them inline

1696972842
LACampbell!~lewis@granite-phrase.bnr.la
no that won't work, because of @This()

1696972870
LACampbell!~lewis@granite-phrase.bnr.la
will make a hacky comptime function
