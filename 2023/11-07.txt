Hey I want to go ahead and ask this question again, then provide some context.

1699379226
copygirl!~koppeh@copy.mcft.net
Will it be possible to compile the Zig compiler to WASM some time? Or may it already be possible?

1699379325
copygirl!~koppeh@copy.mcft.net
I'm asking because I'm dreaming of building a game engine that (if it was possible) pushes technically untrusted code to players for them to compile and run, and I feel like one of the safest ways to do that would be to run it in a WASM sandbox.

1699379364
copygirl!~koppeh@copy.mcft.net
However the compiler itself could have exploits, or use compile time function execution to do naughty stuff, so it too needs to be sandboxes appropriately.

copygirl!~koppeh@copy.mcft.net
I don't think I can have absolute safety, and I will try to do process sandboxing on top of the WASM sandbox. Hopefully that way I will have done enough to protect players from bad actors.

Maybe this idea is still a lost cause, but I'm not sure if I should give up on it just yet.

I could reduce the scope a little, and just have the server compile the code and send the WASM bytecode to players. But there is still an issue with the server owning having to trust the code they're compiling.

Well not just server owners, but also singleplayer users installing mods and such.

Looking at the Minecraft modding ecosystem for example, there has been people exploiting the fact that there is absolutely no sandboxing going on, resulting in (badly written, but nonetheless) malware.

copygirl: maybe the server could spin up and compile in dedicated vms or containers?

1699381374
copygirl!~koppeh@copy.mcft.net
ajr: Isn't that pretty difficult to do in a cross-platform friendly way? It sounds like that would require dedicated Linux servers, and I can kiss goodbye to singleplayer.

I mean if it's the price I have to pay it might be worth it. The idea is to allow for if not target multiplayer modding.

1699381583
copygirl!~koppeh@copy.mcft.net
Actually, I suppose once people have made games and you just want to play them without modding, you can just run the bytecode.

1699381616
copygirl!~koppeh@copy.mcft.net
Difficult if not impossible to verify that some compiled code came from the source code it claimed to come from however.

1699381737

If going that route, I'm not sure how easy it is to include virtualization / containerization within a project, unless I'm okay with making it extra difficult to set up.

at least some of the compiler compiles to WASM as part of the current bootstrapping approach

Yeah I'm very not knowledgeable, but it does feel like Zig compiler running in Wasm might be a real possibility some time in the future.

1699391366
copygirl!~koppeh@copy.mcft.net
If I were to go that route, most other languages that would be able to target Wasm would no longer be options.

Though one of the other reasons why Zig is so tempting is because it would probably be the the ease of packaging it with the game.

hi! can anyone show me an example of a tagged union using empty values in some cases?

1699395563
ekaitz!~Ekaitz@94.73.32.196
something like const Token = union (TokenType) { .open_parens=void ...};

1699395568
ekaitz!~Ekaitz@94.73.32.196
that can be done?

1699395703
ekaitz!~Ekaitz@94.73.32.196
can I just obtain the current tag of the tagged union?

1699395753
ekaitz!~Ekaitz@94.73.32.196
and how can I initialize a Token in my example, for the open_parens case?

1699395756
ekaitz!~Ekaitz@94.73.32.196
if the value is void...

1699395886
jacobly!~jacob@2600:1f18:1fb:6300:1d52:d474:9e12:db33
`@as(TokenType, token)` and `var token: Token = .{ .open_parens = {} };` or `var token: Token = .open_parens;`

1699395953

(not to go off-topic but) copygirl: have you considered Lua? I hear it's great for these kinds of use cases (embedding and sandboxing)
