how can I make "zig build run" out put all the stuff "zig-out/bin/mybinaryname" gives me? it seems to swallow the error messages and just gives me the return code

nektro!~nektro@71-34-68-44.ptld.qwest.net
it only says 'command exited with code <d>' and no stack trace?

1702278251
LACampbell!~lewis@granite-phrase.bnr.la
yeah

1702278256
nektro!~nektro@71-34-68-44.ptld.qwest.net
then the compiler crashed

1702278309
nektro!~nektro@71-34-68-44.ptld.qwest.net
if the command that faled is /zig-cache/o/jksdvsjkdvjskdvjksds/build

let me do some pasting. to clarify, "zig build" works, but "Zig build run" just gives me an error code (my program did indeed return an error code, but it also printed a message, which gets swallowed)

https://bpa.st/ is a good source

https://gist.github.com/LAC-Tech/5fe975bc71adb527f68e868e31299671  does this clarify? the "error opening file" stuff is all legit, it should do that

(did not know about bpa.st, thx)

that shows it didn't eat the error, where in your program are you printing 'err opening file: No such file or directory' ?

1702278629
LACampbell!~lewis@granite-phrase.bnr.la
in the main method? don't understand the significance ot the question

1702278637
LACampbell!~lewis@granite-phrase.bnr.la
it eats the error if I do "zig build run". but not if I just run the binary

1702278665
nektro!~nektro@71-34-68-44.ptld.qwest.net
the error from line 12 is also on line 3

Hello! I was wondering if it's possible to use the Type value of a comptime struct holding that value, like this : `pub fn List(comptime delim: u8, comptime p: anytype) type { ...` and have a `pub fn parse(src: []const u8) !?@TypeOf(p.inner)` method in this struct. inner being defined in all the types used

It tells me to have the `src` arg comptime, but I don't really get why it's not possible without

you can't return a type from a function with runtime arguments

1702314605
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
because types only exist at comptime
