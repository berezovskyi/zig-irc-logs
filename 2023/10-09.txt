is there a Build step or way similar to embedFile?

1696812456
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I would like to embed files that live outside the source tree

1696812635
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
grayhatter, yes, you can use exe.addAnonymousModule()

1696812653
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
whatever name you give it there, you can use that name with `@embedFile`

1696812988
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
is there an easy way to get a list of anonymouse modules? (the number of files and names may change)

1696814064
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
one way would be to the build system to provide that list via options

1696814091
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
exe.addOptions() / b.addOptions()

1696814112
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I tried that with an array list, and got broken memory back

1696814128
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
mmm, `@embedFile` requires the argument to be a string literal, however

1696814147
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
no?

1696814177
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
it'll take any string https://github.com/GrayHatter/srctree/blob/main/src/template.zig#L41

1696814363
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
https://github.com/GrayHatter/srctree/blob/main/build.zig#L15-L22 this will print the filename as expected, but when I @compileLog that same option name, I get broken memory, often random bytes a lot of \x00 but never the filename printed by build.zig

grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
the array/slice sizes are always what they should be

somercet: No, never made a smartphone app with GTK3 in Zig, I did in C though.

Apps are for smartphones, programs are for real computers.

1696821107
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I don't thinkn there's a meaningful distinction there. I've written software where the same code runs across Windows, OSx, Linux, and Android. It didn't go from being a program to an app when I changed the target arch+os. Code is code, the libraries and platforms you use to run the code, and the names you call it matters much less than if it does what it's supposed to for users :) ....and follow up

1696821109
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
question, if you plug a monitor, keyboard and mouse into a smartphone, does it become a "real computer"?

andrewrk: after some time, and as requested, I opened an issue for the TLS client bug: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/17446

hey, when I try to @cImport a header file, I get an error with 'type specifier missing' on a callback definition. Is that a bug? For the record, the declaration is: 

1696843134
soupladl1r!~soupladle@ip2504fbf1.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de
typedef void(*ProcLogCallback)(const char *, size_t, void *);

1696843138
soupladl1r!~soupladle@ip2504fbf1.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de
which seems fine to me

1696843560
nektro!~nektro@71-34-68-44.ptld.qwest.net
typedefs are usually `typedef <type> <name>` and you're missing a name in that one

1696844187
jacobly!~jacob@2600:1f18:1fb:6300:1d52:d474:9e12:db33
the syntax is valid C, it might be complaining about `size_t` not being a known type

no #include <stddef.h>?

hey does anybody know a good project to look at for an example of how to work with C? Stuff like wrapping errors, etc?

Does zig 0.11 require llvm 17, or can it make do with 16?

1696850646
nektro!~nektro@71-34-68-44.ptld.qwest.net
0.11 uses 16

1696850649
squeek502!~squeek502@user/squeek502
somercet, zig 0.11.0 requires llvm 16, latest master requires llvm 17 (but external llvm is only required when building zig, if you're just downloading zig then there's no external dependency on llvm)

soupladl1r: I think that the projects in zig-gamedev show a nice way to wrap C APIs in C for example.

soupladl1r!~soupladle@ip2504fbf1.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de
Thanks, that's just what I was looking for

1696867173
soupladler!~soupladle@ip2504fbf1.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de
does anybody know how you do let o : Option<_> = somevector.get(idx) in zig?

1696867209
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
soupladler: gotta a bit more context?

1696867227
soupladler!~soupladle@ip2504fbf1.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de
I'm trying to do the thing where you take an command line argument or return a default

1696867240
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I'd guess `?[]anytype` but that's almost certainly not what you want to do

1696867244
soupladler!~soupladle@ip2504fbf1.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de
so I'd like something like args[1] orelse "somedefault";

1696867254
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I think that's right

1696867284
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
?[]u8 would be the type for  "somestring" or null

1696867344
soupladler!~soupladle@ip2504fbf1.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de
but is there like a standard non-fallible indexing function like rust's 'get(idx)'?

1696867377
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I'd define an options like struct { arg1: []const u8 = "default val", ... }; then iterate over the args you have and replace the default values as needed

1696867424
soupladler!~soupladle@ip2504fbf1.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de
Ok, cool, that does sound neat. I'm currently just in the stage of writing 'pascal in any language'

1696867437
soupladler!~soupladle@ip2504fbf1.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de
fortran I mean

1696867523
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
yeah, I kinda got that same feeling... and I was gonna mention in, but given you already know, there's nothing wrong with that, you'll clearly figure it out :)

1696867581
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I do that too "how do I translate lang_x syntax into lang_y syntax" are much easier questions than "here's a lot of context, anyone have suggestions"

1696867634
soupladler!~soupladle@ip2504fbf1.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de
so long as you're not coming from APL :)

andrewrk: I'd be glad to open a PR for this, but I'll have to consolidate my knowledge of TLS first (and compile zig from sources and all)
