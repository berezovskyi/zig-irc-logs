grayhatter: I guess I want a function that always does the safety checks. Ideally returning an error if not valid. I couldn't find a function in the standard library. I suppose I'll have to make my own?

copygirl: yeah, I think if you need explicit bounds checking like that, where it just returns an error, you'd probably be writing your own. But I'm curious where that makes more sense than `if (end >= slice.len) return Error.Bounds;`?

Well depends on if I need to reuse it in more than one place.

jacobly0, I'm making issues for regressed behavior tests in the llvm17 branch and opening issues for them

oops, I meant to say, and disabling them with a link to the issue

might be a fun time to introduce time limits to unit tests since I think there is an infinite loop
