at the same time I have meticulously collected all header files for each version: 2.35, 2.36, 2.37, 2.38, and dumped them into universal-headers, as well as uploading a tarball of glibc for every target in case anyone wants to use those artifacts

thanks, just reviewed your PR. It's indeed much nicer to do `git log` instead of collecting the hashes.
