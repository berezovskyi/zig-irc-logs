a question about the build system. say i have some tools, and say they're called (just for example) q3lcc, q3rcc, and q3cpp. i need the resulting tools to be in the same directory when i run them as part of the build process. how would i go about that?

...think i managed to pull it off: const c_run = b.addRunArtifact(q3lcc_tool); c_run.step.dependOn(&install_q3lcc.step);

but it does feel like a quirk of the build system rather than an intentional feature, anyway it now works
