does Zig have visibility modifiers for struct fields?

1599870928
davi2205
or anything that could hide some fields inside a struct?

Boo, readIntLittle won't let me use floats anymore :(

Hello. Is

1599926765
bfredl
or is there some library already that abstracts opengl/glfw ?

1599926812
frett27
think there are several others initiatives that exists, i saw some messages about it, (have you tried to search the archive ?)

1599926838
bfredl
a little

1599926851
bfredl
the wayland compositor stuff by ifreund is probably relevant to my goals

1599926865
bfredl
not sure how much that gets into the opengl/egl layer of thigs

1599926868
bfredl
things

1599926883
bfredl
I have searched github

1599926891
bfredl
but not #zig chat logs or anything like that

1599926917
frett27


1599926932
bfredl
wonderful, I will take a good look at that

1599926937
bfredl
(after eating some fooods)

1599926977
frett27
hope you'll find an opened initiative

1599926999
bfredl
yea, I expect to write lowlevel stuff but it would be nice to bulid on something existing

1599927010
bfredl
work on a common sandcastle rather than a tiny one my own

1599927192
ifreund
bfredl: wlroots handles the rendering abstraction for me

1599927212
ifreund
you might want to consider SDL or similar

1599927539
bfredl
yea. depending on SDL might be a good starting point. "ideally" I only want to depend on system libopengl + minmal toolkit (just to get a X11 or wayland or win32 surface) + whatever zig wrapper already exists. But I can do what is simplest to get started first :]

1599927579
ifreund
well zig-window is what you want, but it's currently at vaporware stage

1599927587
layneson
C is so easy to use from Zig that I just pull in GLFW and Epoxy for OpenGL stuff

1599927614
ifreund
yeah it really just depends what level of abstraction you want to work at

1599927623
ifreund
zig can use all the usual C libs

1599927706
bfredl
Layneson: yea, that would be the "fork Tetris" path

1599927739
bfredl
I just wonder if it be useful to abstract half of Tetris into a lib

1599927753
bfredl
Or someone already done that

1599927782
bfredl
Just to get a surface + keyboard input

1599927799
bfredl
Then the app provides the shaders

1599927869
bfredl
Ok, gotta eat now (but still reading the chan log later)

1599928012
smolck
is there a Zig code formatter somewhere?

1599928087
Michcioperz
like, the built-in `zig fmt`?

1599928156
smolck
yes! how did I not know that existed XD

1599928229
smolck
thank you Michcioperz

1599928283
Michcioperz
i realized it did because the vim plugin automatically runs it when you save

1599928746
smolck
ah, I should PR support for that to Neoformat

1599936684
andrewrk
zig-window is vaporware but check out

1599937376
bfredl
Andrewrk: sure I will look it

1599937401
andrewrk
I haven't tried it yet and it only has "initial commit" so I'm not sure. but I've seen the author in the zig discord

1599937409
andrewrk
so you could ask him about it probably

1599937497
bfredl
andrewrk: BTW, what plattforms will stage2 without LLVM support in the "short term"? amd64 with linux I suppose to start with?

1599937509
bfredl
or amd64 in general I guess

1599937572
andrewrk
bfredl,

1599937640
bfredl
nice

1599937647
bfredl
wasm support is cool, as well

1599937680
bfredl
(I am looking for a small embeddable "jit" for a c like lang, zig stage2 might fit the bill when it is "ready")

nocontent
hi!

1599946074
nocontent
why you have choosed to use spaces for indentation?

1599946123
bfredl
nocontent: what would you use

1599946125
bfredl
form feeds?

1599946153
nocontent
tabs

1599946227
nocontent
using spaces for indentation is a wasted of storage

1599946270
bfredl
reconfiguring my vimrc to use tabs in zig would be a waste of bytes in my vimrc

1599946273
nocontent
i think zig fmt should use tabs

1599946307
nocontent
zig fmt should use tabs like go fmt

1599946337
nocontent
i am not making fun

1599946354
bfredl
neither I am

1599946376
bfredl
data compression is serious business, and I think sparse neural networks gonna revolutionize it very soon

1599946397
nocontent
but using spaces for indentaion is not a good idea

1599946459
nephele
if using spaces is a waste of storage, then so is using letters .-.

1599946484
nocontent
you missed the point

1599946495
nephele
if you require that little storage to be reclaimed you should be using filesystem based compression

1599946522
bfredl
communicating "points" over IRC is waste of freenode network bandwidth

1599946557
nocontent
why would i realy on compression if i can use less bytes

1599946622
nephele
Uhhm, you do know what compression is, right?

1599946631
nocontent
no

1599946636
nephele
representing the same ammount of information in less physical spacre

1599946646
nocontent
i know that

1599946657
nephele
which is exactly what you want to do by using tabs instead of spaces, just that there are far more effective methods

1599946709
nocontent
how?

1599946734
nephele
mathematics

1599946744
nocontent
i know

1599946777
nocontent
why can't i use tabs over spaces?

1599946836
bfredl
you can do it

1599946842
bfredl
we cannot stop you

1599946851
bfredl
use a git filter

1599946855
nocontent
but zig fmt uses spaces

1599946858
bfredl
that converts upstream spaces to tabs on your computer machine

1599946866
bfredl
and vice versa on push

1599946888
nocontent
why can't zig fmt use tabs?

1599946899
bfredl
you can fork it

1599946922
nocontent
then?

1599947016
Snektron


1599947205
nocontent
ok

1599947264
nocontent
but i was blocked by ziglang on github

1599947290
nocontent
i just asked a question

1599947328
nocontent
also on twitter

1599947592
nocontent
the question was, Is there any simpler API?

1599947613
nocontent
to read a file to a buffer

1599947725
nocontent
andrewrk: why?

1599948370
nocontent
exit

1599949596
WilhelmVonWeiner
what is the "rb" namespace?

1599950223
WilhelmVonWeiner
oh it got deleted in master anyway
