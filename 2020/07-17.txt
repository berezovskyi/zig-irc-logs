Isn't it std.io.Writer? I don't think io exports writer.

The error messages are a bit confusing like that.

Hello. I have been trying to get Zig installed on OpenBSD. I first tried getting LLVM 10 installed, but the compilation failed the three times I have tried (including the Zig bootstrap). I also tried building Zig 0.4.0 with the preinstalled LLVM 8, but I get the error, "Zig requires LLVM to be built with all default targets enabled." implying that I must compile it from souorce. Thus, I ask, has anyone here

got Zig installed on OpenBSD, and if so, what steps did you perform?

andrewrk: when running a single benchmark from gotta go fast with the manual command line at the end of the readme, it looks like the `app` package is not taken into account regarding caching, and I need to force rebuild by modifying bench.zig

I think that shouldn't be ?

is there already an API for string sorting?

1595005955
ikskuh
std.sort.sort + a comparison

string sorting is Really Hard

something i'm wondering, has there been any effort to add riscv32 as a target? i managed to kludge something together (based on 0.6.0) which can build and run a hello world in qemu, but i'm wondering if there's been any other efforts in that department - i have some HiFive1 boards that need some love :)

I think the support for it is at the same level as LLVM.

GreaseMonkey
in terms of generating code yeah, but... oh right, i guess i didn't need to do any modifications to get it to at least work on bare metal, i was compiling it for riscv32-linux-gnu lol

riscv32-freestanding-none ought to work out of the box.

next part i'm wondering is how one could go about getting the standard I/O working in -freestanding, i'm getting errors pertaining to os.fd_t not existing when doing warn(), and it's part of the file structure definition

You'll have to hook up a serial port or something yourself.

i definitely know how to interface the serial port, the thing i don't know is how to then hook that up to the zig stdlib

I think you'll want to wrap it in std.io.Reader and std.io.Writer, and use those. I don't know if there's a way to override stderr and stdout, though that would do it.

1595021141
leeward
Oh, hmm, std.log doesn't use a particular stream by default. You could probably hook that into the Writer.

1595021238
leeward
Well that's a lie. std.log does use stderr, but you can override it.

alright, power's going out soon, so i'll go with what i can, thanks for the help
