Can someone explain to me why this doesn't work as expected?

1588828392
watzon
I just end up with `0 1` - `0 59` and it stops on the first iteration

1588828536

`var y` needs to be in the middle of the x loop

1588828548

Oof

1588828553

Duh

Hello. I'm learning Zig. Zig is statically typed, but does it have type inference? I haven't seen it anywhere in the documentation but I think I have seen variable declarations and assignments without specifying the type.

1588845441
daurnimator
cren: in most places yes

1588845455
cren
Is there no special syntax for it?

1588845457
daurnimator
cren: notably, zig doesn't allow type inference in return value types

1588845466
daurnimator
most other places have inference.

1588845487
cren
daurnimator: can you give an example to explain the return value thing

1588845502
daurnimator
cren: no. `const foo = bar` ==> foo becomes the type of bar. `const foo: sometype = bar` ==> you're declaringn the type of foo explicitly

1588845530
cren
Ah. Well that's what I had guessed. Just wanted to make sure.

1588845540
daurnimator
cren: `fn foo(bar: var) mytype { return bar; }` => `mytype` must be explicit

1588845563
cren
Oh right. I see. I wouldn't have expected anything else.

1588845693
cren
Thank you.

has anyone had success in using the llvm10 provided by nix for building izg?

1588861882

zig* ?

1588862612
cren
Does Zig use UPPER_CASE_LIKE_THIS for names of program constants at all?

1588862664
ikskuh
i haven't seen it yet

1588862688
ifreund
style guide says to only use it when conforming to something like errno values

Nevermind, stole andrews ZIg nix shell and that works

1588865995

okie, mikdusan do you know how to override the libSystem library that gets linked? nix explicitly removes some symbols to keep reproducible builds with 10.12, and they told me to find out how to override the link with the real `/usr/lib/libSystem.dylib` but I don't know anything about cmake

I'm going through the zig live coding webcasts to get an appreciated for the language, in some of the old videos the source code contains an examples folder, the closest I can see is test/standalone.

1588868128
drp
Is that the right place to look or am I just overlooking something?

1588868210
plumm
thats probably super old, a good place for examples is the standard library (found in lib/std)

1588868440
drp
thank you!

1588868490
drp
I've noticed some of the coding projects don't work with the latest zig due to age, so it's probably a better source to check out

1588872802

nakedcc no longer exists, this appears to be replaced with callconv(.Naked), searching through the git logs showed that fmt automatically converts old code to the new, cool! But this functionality doesn't appear to be in the docs. Are there documentation areas other than

1588872837
andrewrk
drp, not everything is documented yet

1588872869
andrewrk
a first draft of the language specification is one of the goals of 0.7.0 though, so that should help

1588873082
drp
that's fair enough, thank you.

1588873729
ikskuh
andrewrk: i think pretty much everyone except you will have an A-HA moment when you unconver all undocumented features :D

Dominic[m]: hi I read your message from yesterday, I've been discussing it now on stream. I see your point, and we can certainly make the presentation stream not require any account (you can watch twitch without one), but for interacting it seems to me that one way or another some kind of account is needed and Discord does make some things easier on my end (plus it's less friction than IRC for a lot of people for example)

How many things do we know of that hang the compiler and produce no error messages?

1588890131
gonz_
I have one case where I add code to a `main` that I execute successfully in a test, but when it's in main it'll just straight up hang the compiler.

1588891959
gonz_
Hmm, two different `@cImport`s that pointed to the same lib. I would've expected that to error, not just hang the compiler..

1588891977
gonz_
Anyway, that seems to have been the issue, if anyone stumbles upon it in the future.
