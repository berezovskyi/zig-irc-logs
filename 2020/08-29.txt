I'm new to zig (and never learned C), what's the zig equivalent of char** ?

1598664621
msingle
*[_]u8 ?

1598664704
shakesoda
usually you want something like [_][]u8

interesting that you cannot answer the question " what's the zig equivalent of char**" without a lot of context questions :D

1598701462
shakesoda
ikskuh: yeah

1598701567
shakesoda
i figured the actual question was how to write an array of strings and not how to interface with an actual char** through some external c stuff

1598701577
shakesoda
didn't hear back, so i guess that was on the mark?

Hey everyone, I am porting liburing to Zig. Does anyone know Zig's AtomicOrder version of std::memory_order_relaxed?

1598711865
jorangreef
I guess it's AtomicOrder.Unordered?

1598712042
ifreund
that seems right to me

1598712104
ifreund
or maybe not "@atomicRmw atomic ordering must not be Unordered"

Thanks Isaac, I need it for an @atomicStore and an @atomicLoad.

1598712381
ifreund
yeah it should work for those

1598712406
ifreund
we could definetly use some more complete documentation here
