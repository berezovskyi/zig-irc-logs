I also have no clue if im writing good/idomatic stage2 code, so it would be nice to know before moving on and doing more stuff

has anyone gotten Tracy's callstack capture to work with Zig? the only stack frame it's capturing for me is the tracy instrumentation function itself, none of Zig's callstack. I'm not sure if it can be expected to work, though.

1605419330
pixelherodev
dominikh: Tracy in zig is only for stage2 I think?

1605419336
pixelherodev
Unless you mean in your own program

1605419343
pixelherodev
In which case I have noooo clue

1605419359
dominikh
yeah, in my own program.

1605419377
dominikh
I have absolutely no idea how stack frames are represented in Zig, but I guess they're different enough from C

1605419408
pixelherodev
dominikh: check how stage2 does it?

1605419413
pixelherodev
It's definitely possible

1605419416
pixelherodev
The compiler uses it

1605419428
pixelherodev
src/tracy.zig I believe

1605419457
dominikh
does it actually successfully capture stack traces for zones? you can get

1605419495
pixelherodev
Ah, stack traces... no idea

1605419498
pixelherodev
Could be

1605419517
pixelherodev
andrewrk would know, I believe

1605419529
pixelherodev
You can always check

1605424876
dominikh
well, I can't get stage 2 to build with tracy enabled, and since it looks like a C++ issue, I'm not going to dig further :) I'm pretty sure zig isn't doing anything more to integrate Tracy than I am, anyway

1605438172
dominikh
idiomatically, if a function can only succeed or fail, and doesn't differentiate between kinds of errors, and otherwise returns void, should it return a !void or a bool?

1605440180
daurnimator
!void probably

1605440261
dominikh
been leaning towards that, too

is it the same, rather strict, "no shadowing" rule?

1605449976
g-w1
yes it is. consider this `const x = 10; pub fn main() {const x = 10;}` it is the same thing

1605450173
g-w1
the upper x is visible from the function namespace, so it can't be refedined

1605450227

fair

Beginner question: How do I catenate a string literal and text I've brought in at runtime (of type []u8)?

i think they want to concatonate at runtime, so ++ wont work

1605454514
waleee-cl
ah, ok

1605454605
g-w1
viaken, what you probably want to do is to allocate a slice of the compile time slice plus the runtime slice, then copy the compile time slice into it and the runtime slice after the compile time slice

1605454896
ifreund
std.mem.concat?

1605454951
g-w1
ig you could also do that. i didn't know about that :P

1605455059
viaken
I'll have to concatenate at runtime, yeah. It's a little hook util that takes an argument and then adds the argument to a message it passes to a different util.

well there is some eu money to be dispensed, but the pool is overwhelmed by western countries, and in the interest of balance eastern countries are prefered.

Hi all, I've had my eyes on zig for few months, but never actually tried to learn it. Until recently. The cross compiling feature is amazing. Anyway, I'm trying to make developing bit easier, I'm not finding easy to use print statements, but analyzing other zig code I stumbled on this

1605480165
g-w1
it seems that this is the standard library of vexu's bog programming language. this doesn't affect zig's standard library at all. if you could give an example of where printing something was hard, i think the community could help you

1605480169
g-w1
hlolli

1605480217
betawaffle
to start with, what are you trying to print, hlolli?

1605480359
hlolli
thanks, I realize in bog's example it makes total sense, using std.log.info is fine as well as I don't need to catch it. In comparison to const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer(); stdout.print("somelog\n", .{}) catch unreachable;, it's a bit nicer. But a printing arrays or hashmaps, I'd be happy if there was a snippet for printing various datatypes, but this is no blocker.

1605480437
g-w1
well you could make wrapper functions to view data structures (iterating through hashmap). iirc though, std.fmt can print structs and maybe arrays

1605480596
hlolli
ah nice ok! didn't know. Exactly, wrapper functions. Related or unrelated to this, are there any zig libraries with helper/wrapper goodies for development. I notice on the website, the community projects are only "end product". In a good way, zig seems to offer a lot of customizations and seems to leave sugars to the user, which makes me wonder if there's a list of projects somewhere I didn't see.

1605480678

nice nice, I already have emacs package running, very nice. I'll bookmark these two and try to get zpm running. I was also scratching my head over if there was any package management in the language. Seems like there is.

Is there a way to check for a compile error in a unit test?

1605482894
adamkowalski
I have some compile time checks that should prevent a certain class of domain specific bugs

1605482907
adamkowalski
and I want to unit tests my compile time checks

1605483823
pfg_
adamkowalski, not right now unfortunately. I had to redo lots of my comptime stuff to return compile errors out so I could test them in unit tests.

1605484442
adamkowalski
Yeah I ended up doing something similar

1605484452
adamkowalski
rather than checking for the compile error directly

1605484471
adamkowalski
extract the checker into a function and then assert that it evaluates to false, and returns the correct message

1605484516
adamkowalski
but now that it is working, it feels incredible. I can't believe I can check all this stuff at compile time, and my types encode all the information they need so that they are "impossible" to misuse
