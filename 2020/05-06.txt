kristoff_it: short of making a full-on issue and exposing myself. My worry as a non-member of discord is that I'll need to setup an account on another platform - which is a friction for me. I wonder if it might be for others too. I'd really like to attend though!

hi guys, does anybody have an idea about how much effort would be to write ebpf code in zig as opposed to C?

1588761981
ikskuh
should be a bit less code actually

1588762008
ikskuh
but you have to provide the macros for BPF_STX_MEM yourself

1588762115

ikskuh: i am totally new to ebpf and i would like to avoid writing C at all cost :)

1588762216
ikskuh
yeah you can use zig instead of C here :)

Employees do dev talk each month on tech/programming, doesnâ€™t have to be work related

looks interesting

FireFox317_, I think it may be time to enable evented I/O tests on the CI :)

1588785298
andrewrk
at least for the OS's on which it is working

1588785532

andrewrk, yes indeed i think so too

Not sure how I should use FreeType from Zig. The documented way to use it is with `#include <ft2build.h>` followed by `#include FT_FREETYPE_H`. Unsuprisingly, Zig is not happy to translate the macro `#define FT_FREETYPE_H <header_location.h>`

1588786284
ifreund
pmwhite: you could make a shim header that does than include, then @cInclude your shim from zig

1588786471
pmwhite
That's worked. But why? I thought Zig eventually will translate the entire header, which involves everything that each header includes?

1588786636
andrewrk
ifreund, pmwhite: @cImport blocks support @cDefines

1588786643
andrewrk


1588786771

i don't think you can @cInclude with a path string from a macro though

1588786771
ifreund
andrewrk: FT_FREETYPE_H is a define for the header location that need to be imported, i dont think zig can do that?

1588786791
pmwhite
^

1588786817
ifreund
pmwhite: i don't know why it works lol

1588786849
pmwhite
It expands to `<freetype/freetype.h>`, which is simple enough that I could just use that, but it's not the documented way.

1588786893

1588786909
ifreund
does it always though? there's got to be some reason freetype wants you to do that

1588787082
ifreund
i mean as far as I understand it #2070 just lets you do what you can already do by creating a custom c header to import from inline

1588788554
andrewrk
that's correct

1588788561
andrewrk
you could always just make a .h file and @cImport that

I found quite weird behavior of @sizeOf(packed struct):

1588790804
fengb
Yeah packed structs are buggy

I made a gdb pretty printer for stage1 ZigList

1588793394
xackus
andrewrk do you want it in the main repo?

1588793431
andrewrk
xackus, sure if it doesn't cause any problems with the build system

1588793436
andrewrk
that sounds handy

1588793447
xackus
it won't

1588793487
xackus
it is handy, but there are plenty of lists that are not ZigLists

1588795822
xackus
andrewrk take a look at

1588795847
xackus
is tools the appropriate directory?
