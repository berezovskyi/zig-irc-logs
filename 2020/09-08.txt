ky0ko and ronsor, I see you two have mentioned DOS targets in the last month or so. I just released some proof of concept code that might interest you. It uses pure Zig to create a simple DOS program. No reliance on DJGPP (for better or worse).

we don't have any zig code that converts a std.Target to an LLVM triple yet, do we?
