is there a way to get a normal `fn` from a `bound fn`?

nevermind. I figured it out.

Hi, does anybody know if there is a way to express the desired alignment for a struct? something like "alignas" in C++? I can see that I can specify it when instantiating, but I can't find the syntax for defining it on a type

for normal structs I don't think there is a way since the compiler is free to reorder the fields at will, you'd have to specify it when instantiating

Does anyone know if there's anything in the std library for finding out if a file path refers to a directory, file or whatever? I'm catching errors when opening the path and trying to read it, which is very unwealdy right now

there's stat() on std.fs which you can use to check if a file is a file with .kind == .File, but not aware of anything like that for paths/directories

Ah, I think same strategy should work on Dir handles as internally it's just a file description, which means you can also call stat() on a Dir struct

ah, interesting, thanks

ifreund_ even if the compiler reorder them, the alignment constrain won't change for the type. My issue is that If I say that I want a 3 byte struct aligned at 4, i still get the sizeOf of 3 instead of 4, and that's weird as I would expect sizeof to express the distance between two object in an array of item of that type. I can handle it manually,

so I guess is alright.

BoilerOnASurf: the compiler is theoretically also free to e.g. only pass the subset of a struct that is actually used in a function to that function, possibly leaving out fields which would cause greater alignment

ifreund but that won't change the value of ``@sizeOf(@TypeOf(my_parameter))`` as the type is the same

I have a snippet but I'm not sure where is better to ask this question, what if I ask on StackOverflow and post the link here? is that fine or there is a better place?

Code doesn't paste well in IRC, so you'd want to put the code into a pastebin or similar and link it here with the question. Nothing wrong with asking on something like SO and linking it, either.

I'm just experimenting with zig networking and ran into this strangeness that someone could perhaps explain:

If I store the result of the switch in a var, it works as expected
