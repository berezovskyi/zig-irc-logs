is it possible to `suspend` from within a deeply nested function (with C functions on the stack too)?

daurnimator, what a lame article that doesn't define what a "bad name" is

1598843650
scientes
daurnimator, and the reason you know about it is lwn

you read this article

maybe? though equally likely that I heard about it at a conference; or when reading diffs of uapi headers.

ok strict mode is based on utf8_validate

1598844010
scientes
....which is a generate c source file

1598844133
scientes
so...there is a no easily-accessible even description of what a "bad character" is

1598844158
scientes
oh here it says

- The values encoded are 0x1..0x10FFFF.

1598844167
scientes
- The surrogate codepoints 0xD800..0xDFFFF are not encoded.

1598844167
scientes
- The shortest possible encoding is used for all values.

so; the reason I shared it here was the fact that the linux implementation requires tying a specific version of the unicode standard to the file system

1598844356

I've been wondering about how we should do different unicode versions in zig.

1598844402
daurnimator
e.g. say we add case-normalization today with unicode 12. unicode 13 comes out with some changes: do we just upgrade to it? won't this have user-visible consequences?

are these changes backward compatible? I naively thought they were

1598848832

companion_cube: depends what you do with them.
