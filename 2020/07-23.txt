Almost at the point where I figure out just how broken stage2 gets when there's a zero-register architecture :P

1595464588
andrewrk
s/broken/unimplemented/

1595464598
pixelherodev
Well, sorta

1595464602
pixelherodev
A bit of both

1595464612
pixelherodev
I don't think we have a proper fallback for when we can't allocate a register, for instance

1595464632
pixelherodev
Actually, I think the

1595464916
shakesoda
you've got something register free?

1595468367
pixelherodev
shakesoda: SPU II has no general-purpose registers

1595468381
pixelherodev
Stack pointer, instruction pointer, flag register, base pointer <- four registers only

1595468408
fengb
Wasm has no registers

1595468530
pixelherodev
huh

1595468534
pixelherodev
good to know

1595468560
fengb
Well it has locals that can be thought of as registers. So infinite registers?

1595468562
shakesoda
i suppose that makes sense

1595468572
fengb
Depends on your POV :P

1595468599
pixelherodev
Found the SPU-II issue

1595468610
pixelherodev
There's some x64-specific code being generated even when arch != .x86_64

1595468853
pixelherodev
Okay, back to where I was pre-rebase :)

1595479084
andrewrk
my goodness azure, what is your problem now

1595479089
andrewrk
you are so needy

1595479608
pixelherodev
andrewrk: any reason not to host our own CI?

1595479660
andrewrk
opportunity cost

1595479674
pixelherodev
Not worth the time?

1595479734
andrewrk
right this minute I'm working on stage2. I'm not going to drop it and work on the CI

1595479741
pixelherodev
Agreed

1595479749
pixelherodev
On that note, I should figure out the codegen issue for SPU II

1595479769
torque
gitlab's ci is ridiculously easy to set up on custom hardware

1595479802
pixelherodev
There's easier (and better) too, but it's still an investment in time

1595479822
pixelherodev
Not just short-term either

1595479828
pixelherodev
It means you have to maintain it long-term

1595480553
daurnimator
torque: lies. outside of x86_64 is essentially broken

1595480632
daurnimator
oh looks like

1595481592
torque
idk, we've been running it on raspi 4's at work for a while

1595481653
torque
also, I suspect this is probably only needed for the docker integration based on the mr description

1595481676
torque
since it's written in go there shouldn't be anything stopping the basic shell runner from working on any arch go supports?

1595481703
torque
frankly, the way docker supports different architectures is hot garbage anyway

1595482279
daurnimator
torque: we have access to powerful arm64 servers; tried to set up gitlab runner on them for zig; and ran into a whole load of things including that pr i linked

1595483296
torque
interesting

1595484772
andrewrk
oh yeah that was disappointing

1595492757
danyspin97
is there any way to iterate over files in a dir?

1595492950
ifreund
danyspin97: see Dir.iterate()

1595493002
danyspin97
ifreund: thanks!

1595495992
danyspin97
ifreund: I am reading the std.fs tests, and Dir.iterate is almost clear to me

1595496011
danyspin97
but I can't understand how to create a Dir from a path

1595496121
ifreund
std.fs.cwd().openDir()

1595496138
danyspin97
and without cwd?

1595496172
danyspin97
i.e. open /tmp/mydir

1595496174
squeek502
still use cwd() and pass an absolute path

1595496187
danyspin97
ah, I see

1595496208
danyspin97
a little counterintuitive though

1595496212
squeek502
yeah seems to be a source of confusion for a lot of people

1595496247
squeek502
as i understand it, its to better support platforms like WASI that don't have a concept of an absolute path

1595496316
ifreund
this, and to encourage use of relative paths wherever possible

1595496332
ifreund
note that fs.cwd() is basically free on most platforms

1595496348
ifreund
you can even call it at comptime on some

1595496397
ifreund
on everything except windows and wasi infact

1595496440
danyspin97
std.fs.cwd().openDir(path)

1595496456
danyspin97
std.fs.cwd().openDir(path, OpenDirOptions{})

1595496491
danyspin97
I assumed it was std.fs.cwd(path)

1595499721
danyspin97
why is the compiler complaining here?

1595499735
danyspin97


1595499799
danyspin97
(it says that there is no addType function)

1595499944
squeek502
danyspin97, you need to do const Rules = @import("Rules.zig).Rules;

1595499970
squeek502
you're getting the file's namespace rather than the pub const Rules struct within it

1595499984
danyspin97
Ah yea

1595499997
danyspin97
but shouldn't have the compiler complained before?

1595500019
danyspin97
when I declared `rules: *Rules`

1595500036
squeek502
no, files are valid structs as well

1595500057
danyspin97
ah, I see

1595500148
ifreund
danyspin97: note that you can totally use toplevel fields in files and then import and use them as `cons Rules = @import("Rules.zig");`

1595500174
ifreund
e.g.

1595500222
squeek502
was just about to link a similar example, zls does that as well:

1595509314
danyspin97
ifreund: ah, so river wm is yours

1595509318
danyspin97
nice project

1595510295
ifreund
thanks!

1595510360
danyspin97
I haven't tried it yet because the AUR package does not work

1595510386
danyspin97
with zig master

1595510436
ifreund
ah yeah, I decieded to stick with 0.6.0 to make packaging and contributing easier

1595510451
danyspin97
yea, that's nice

1595510480
danyspin97
I'll package it for exherbo when zig compiles there for me

1595510532
danyspin97
I guess I can add a (kind of) eclass for zig packgaes

1595510559
ifreund
that'd be cool, though I've haven't actually done an 0.1.0 release yet

1595510617
ifreund
I daily drive river and it works quite well, but there are a couple more features I want before a first release

1595513447
fengb
0.1 is the new 1.0 :P

1595513509
ifreund
indeed :P

1595513732
ikskuh
fengb: so you say i should release dunstblick 0.1 now? :D

1595514403
danyspin97
ikskuh: any link? :D

1595514488
ifreund


1595514519
ifreund
ikskuh: I see that zig finally overtook c++ :D

1595515081
danyspin97
the site isn't working though

1595516668
ikskuh
danyspin97: yeah, i forgot to patch that up

1595516672
ikskuh
should do that later

1595516688
ikskuh
ifreund: it will continue that way until i'm done

1595516718
ikskuh
also: it works for certain values of "works" :D

1595516736
ikskuh
has a lot of  TODOs still and may crash at the first unexpected event, but hey. it works!

1595516805
ikskuh
latest push: 50.7% zig code

1595516840
ifreund
ikskuh: I'm not sure I'm grasping the vision of dunstblick, how do you plan to use this?

1595516848
ikskuh
aaah

1595516865
ikskuh
are you okay with spoilers for my next showtime talk? :D

1595516872
ifreund
sure :D

1595516879
ikskuh
i figured that dunstblick may be the right project for a talk

1595516893
ikskuh
i create a lot of self-made IoT devices

1595516908
ikskuh
small scale (lpc1786 or smaller) or large scale (RPI, ...)

1595516921
ikskuh
also i have a lot of services deployed on several machines

1595516949
ikskuh
my vision for dunstblick is to access all those systems with a very resource-gentle UI system

1595516980
ikskuh
web stack is too bloatet imho for that, it also requires you to write a lot of web servers and html/js frontends

1595517008
ifreund
neat, this is making a lot more sense with that use-case in mind

1595517009
ikskuh
so the idea of dunstblick is that you can easily discover applications in your local network and attach a interface to them

1595517031
ikskuh
for example: i have a rack with RGB LEDs built-in

1595517040
ikskuh
and i want to set the color/animation for those

1595517054
ikskuh
open up dunstblick, attach to "LED Control", change some colors, done

1595517062
ikskuh
same workflow for everything else

1595517072
ifreund
sounds quite handy

1595517079
ikskuh
the network-controllable power board? sure thing :D

1595517084
ikskuh
attach, flip some checkboxes, done :D

1595517090
ifreund
what all do your IoT devices do?

1595517103
ikskuh
right now, not that much :D

1595517125
ikskuh
i have these two i told you about, but i also have my stereo as IoT

1595517131
ikskuh
it's just an RPI+Amp

1595517142
ifreund
nice

1595517143
ikskuh
and i would like to control the media playing there not via SSH anymore :D

1595517162
ikskuh
another example: you could make a generic pulseaudio volume control

1595517179
ikskuh
throw that on all your machines and you can now control volume of your computer with your smartphone

1595517196
ikskuh
have a weather service sampling data from your local weather station? covered :D

1595517233
ikskuh
(i should add that conversation to the repo :D )

1595517244
ikskuh
and maybe write that down in a less conversation-style some time

1595517265
ikskuh
but i plan to make dunstblick also available as a normal application development UI system without networking

1595517293
ifreund
that would certainly help people grasp what dunstblick can do

1595517506
ikskuh
yeha

1595517708
danyspin97
cool project ikskuh

1595517714
ikskuh
thanks :)

1595519339
ikskuh
ifreund, could you test dunstblick later? i would like to get my dependency list up to date :)

1595519343
ikskuh
i reduced it a lot

1595519530
ifreund
ikskuh: sure, probably have time this evening

1595519554
ikskuh
nice

1595531888
pixelherodev
ikskuh: what

1595531905
ikskuh
working!

1595531920
ikskuh
it's my UI framework which is now 50% written in zig :)

1595531957
ifreund
haze gaze is my current translation to english

1595531978
ikskuh
ah :D

1595531989
ikskuh
it's a german wordplay

1595532008
ikskuh
dunst is haze, mist or fog

1595532008
ifreund
mist look?

1595532010
leeward
cloudy clouds?

1595532023
ikskuh
probably haze is the most fitting

1595532033
fengb
Why are we gazing at Haze?

1595532038
ifreund
i love the sound of haze gaze tbh

1595532046
ikskuh
blick is "look" as in "the look she gave me"

1595532054
leeward
I thought this was a no-hazing club.

1595532067
ikskuh
but: there's a german word "Dunstkreis"

1595532106
ifreund
like a ring of haze?

1595532106
ikskuh
which dict.cc translates as "society" which is right, but also completly wrong :D

1595532131
ikskuh
dunstkreis is the set of people with which you have regular contact

1595532138
ikskuh
like your friends, workplace, ...

1595532160
ikskuh
so the question "to which dunstkreis do you belong?" could be answered with "I'm one of thoe Zig people"

1595532163
ifreund
ok kreis makes sense, but I don't get the dunst part

1595532191
ikskuh
i cannot explain it more, it's a pretty specific german word

1595532206
ikskuh
but the bigger project is called "dunstwolke", so "misty cloud"

1595532230
ikskuh
which is a kind of (computer) cloud which is defined by your immediate (computer) surrounding

1595532238
ikskuh
and dunstblick is just a variation of dunstwolke

1595532294
ikskuh
"ikskuh --explain dunstblick" completed

1595532309
ifreund
oh I understand what a dunstkreis is now, just don't follow the logic behind the Kompositum

1595532363
ikskuh
aah, well. the project is way bigger than dunstblick alone ;)

1595532413
ikskuh
so dunstblick itself doesn't really make sense :D

1595532424
ifreund
no, but it sounds cool

1595532510
ikskuh
that's what i figured as well

1595532519
ikskuh
so i've gone with it :D

1595532626
ikskuh
i wonder if the @fieldParentPtr stuff is good enough to do a UI library with it

1595532632
ikskuh
without getting too inconvenient

1595532713
andrewrk
ikskuh, have you seen the foo.cast(T) pattern?

1595532723
andrewrk
it's pretty reasonable IMO

1595532761
andrewrk


1595532762
ifreund
i mean, gtk is written in C

1595532775
ifreund
I'm sure you can pull something off

1595532929
andrewrk
there are 2 functions in the above example because I introduced a non 1-to-1 correspondance between the type and the tag

1595532934
ikskuh
andrewrk, no i haven't yet

1595532962
andrewrk
in practice it looks like: if (widget.cast(ScrollBar)) |sb| sb.moveToBottom();

1595533004
andrewrk
or just widget.cast(ScrollBar).?.moveToBottom();

1595533044
andrewrk
honestly starting to think about closing #130 with no plan for dynamic dispatch at all

1595533080
andrewrk
if somebody made a GUI lib with reasonable API it would seal the deal

1595533252
shakesoda
i've been doing gui where the widgets are just enum/int typed with a unique id/index for whatever data they have. it doesn't have different actual types for widgets, they are just layout items

1595533336
shakesoda
i should port that to zig

1595533435
shakesoda
it's a derivative of this, and the huge comment on top probably explains it better than i will

1595533665
andrewrk
I think I've solved result locations in a clean way in self hosted

1595533902
fengb
🎉

1595534065
andrewrk
meanwhile azure is shitting its pants

1595534072
ikskuh
<andrewrk> if somebody made a GUI lib with reasonable API it would seal the deal

1595534075
ikskuh
i am afraid :D

1595534109
ikskuh
it might be my job to kill #130

1595534289
ifreund
do it! in the words of andrew kelly, "abstraction is overrated"

1595534591
shakesoda
needless abstraction is the cause of most software complexity

1595534628
ifreund
yup

1595535724
pixelherodev
andrewrk: result locations solved

1595535746
andrewrk
yeah hope you're ready for some "fun" rebasing :P

1595535757
pixelherodev
Mind giving me like

1595535764

six hours to finish up the PRs before you merge that?

1595535797
andrewrk
0 codegen.zig changes fwiw

1595535833
andrewrk
it's mostly in astgen.zig and related

1595535876
ifreund
man I can't wait to get to use stage 2

1595535937
pixelherodev
Oh sick

1595535942
pixelherodev
That means I probably don't have to rebase

1595535944
pixelherodev
No linker changes?

1595535952
andrewrk
none

1595535952
pixelherodev
Perfect

1595536108
pixelherodev
ikskuh: Okay stupid question, but do you mind encoding an instruction for me? :P

1595536122
ikskuh
yeah, i'm at the phone right now :D

1595536127
ikskuh
ask some binary editor or something :D

1595536584
pixelherodev
ikskuh: heh, heh, uh, yeah

1595536619
pixelherodev
Shouldn't 0x088E (little endian) be a load16???

1595536641
pixelherodev
I wanted to do a proper encoding (`@bitCast(u16, Instruction{})`) but it hits a TODO in stage1 :(

1595536647
pixelherodev
It can't do that at compile time I think

1595536655
pixelherodev
Might work if I make it var?

1595536812
pixelherodev
Huh, yep!

1595536833
pixelherodev
Woot, it works now!

1595537074
pixelherodev
Woot, it fully works!

1595537086
pixelherodev
Generates a valid ELF, which the emulator can run!

1595537176
ikskuh
NICE

1595537181
ikskuh
what was the test program?

1595537182
pixelherodev
Pushed ;)

1595537188
pixelherodev
You can take a look your - oh wait no

1595537191
pixelherodev
It's not in the test suite

1595537195
pixelherodev
Let me just fix that

1595537206
pixelherodev
It calls a function killEmulator() which is `asm volatile("undefined0");`

1595537305
ikskuh
:D

1595537327
andrewrk
tfw you have a ZIR instruction called coerce_result_block_ptr

1595537375
pixelherodev
lol

1595537481
pixelherodev
I love that the GOT calls are one instruction :)

1595537529
andrewrk
honestly I think our debug builds are going to have quite reasonable perf

1595537540
pixelherodev
Definitely

1595537541
ikskuh
andrewrk: that's good to hear :)

1595537557
pixelherodev
Uhh, `LLVM ERROR: 64-bit WebAssembly (wasm64) is not currently supported` ??

1595537562
pixelherodev


1595537573
andrewrk
wasm64 doesn't exist

1595537583
pixelherodev
Right, I have no idea why it thinks it should be targeting that

1595537597
andrewrk
the CI gods are angry today

1595537607
pixelherodev
Maybe it's because I messed up when adding to std.Target?

1595537738
pixelherodev
I'd run the tests locally but potato

1595538081
ikskuh
pixelherodev: what is os "spu_2"?

1595538094
pixelherodev
Wait what?

1595538098
pixelherodev
I didn't mark it as an os!

1595538135
ikskuh
huh

1595538143
ikskuh
wait, i've read that wrong

1595538161
pixelherodev
In self.os.tag?

1595538167
pixelherodev
The switch thingy there?

1595538406
ikskuh
pixelherodev: btw, we can just integrate a 100% zig written assembler for spu mk2 :D

1595539025
ikskuh
ifreund: still awake for some testing?

1595539055
ifreund
ikskuh: lets do it, cloning the repo

1595539059
ikskuh
wait a sec

1595539063
ikskuh
still ripping out stuff :D

1595539078
ifreund
heh

1595539087
ikskuh
less code → better

1595539096
ifreund
of course

1595539173
ifreund
I think river should never break 10k LoC

1595539209
ifreund
I'm at 4k right now but am missing a few major features

1595539263

suckless wouldn't be all that impressed I know, but it significantly less that e.g. sway

1595539275
ifreund

Oh wait, 4k is a giant test

1595539527
ifreund
oh, yeah I guess river might be a little under 4k then if I exclude tests

1595539562
ifreund
I don't have very many though to be honest

1595539563
ikskuh
ifreund: you can clone now, only external dependency is sdl2, don't forget to checkout submodules

1595539564

I'm sad that my toy emulator has as many lines as your real project :(

1595539682
ifreund
well, my line count is going to jump up a good bit when I implement damage tracking

1595539690
ifreund
complexity as well

1595539797
ikskuh
i'm excited to see if it will build on first try or not :D

1595539803
ikskuh
and even more:

1595539824
ifreund
ikskuh: hmmm

1595539841
ikskuh
eerrrrrm

1595539850
ifreund
I think my zig build is a few days old

1595539857
ikskuh
or too new :D

1595539861
ikskuh
i'm going to update mine and check

1595539869
ikskuh
okay, i'm at current from website

1595539935
ifreund
just rebuilt master and it seems to have made it to the c++ code

1595539998
ikskuh
oho

1595540030
ifreund
ikskuh: alright, this is where I'm at

1595540054
ikskuh
okay nice!

1595540062
ikskuh
you did "zig build run", right?

1595540077
ikskuh
ah, both run and normal build

1595540091
ikskuh
open another terminal and start calculator and minimal from the cache dir :)

1595540177
ifreund
heh, calculator looks funny at this scale

1595540214
ikskuh
but: the zig experience is real :D

1595540215
ikskuh
it works :d

1595540233
ifreund
minimal seems to work as well

1595540278
ikskuh
wonderful :)

1595540285
ifreund
yes, running a experimental zig networked gui framework thing inside an experimental zig wayland compositor

1595540303
ifreund
andrewrk should be proud of us :D

1595540304
ikskuh
with an experimental compiler :D

1595540332
leeward
Does wayland itself still count as experimental?

1595540353
andrewrk
wow

1595540380
ifreund
leeward: the core protocol? no. the ecosystem? yes

1595540386
leeward
Fair enough.

1595540392
ikskuh
ecosystem is definitly experimental

1595540410
ikskuh
i'm using it for some time now, but i will probably go back to x11+i3

1595540423
ikskuh
i've lost some valueable parts of my workflow

1595540443
ifreund
ikskuh: curious, what in particular?

1595540458
ikskuh
screen sharing, mostly

1595540474
ikskuh
ad-hoc sharing from any program (obs, discord, jitsi, ...)

1595540485
ifreund
yeah that works (i did it for showtime) but is still experimental

1595540485
ikskuh
also sway glitches keyboard input

1595540495
ikskuh
repeated key presses when none are happening

1595540496
ikskuh
lost keys

1595540509
ikskuh
broken input states (meta key doesn't react anymore)

1595540530
ifreund
interesting, I never noticed any weirdness there in sway myself

1595540567
ifreund
I wonder if it would happen in river for you as well

1595540581
ikskuh
how often do you send your machine to standby? :D

1595540594
ikskuh
it often loses info when awaking from standby

1595540603
ifreund
hmm, not regularly

1595540613
ikskuh
for me it's the default mode

1595540622
ifreund
that'd probably be worth reporting though

1595540647
ifreund
It's certianly something that should be solved

1595540655
ikskuh
yeah

1595540660
ikskuh
but i cannot reproduce it

1595540669
ikskuh
so i can only say "it happens"

1595540673
ikskuh
not why, not when

1595540676
ikskuh
it's just a gut feeling atm

1595540686
ifreund
no fun :(

1595540710
ikskuh
yeah

1595540720
ikskuh
and i have no time for making nice bug repots

1595541126
leeward
Is there a version of @truncate that chops off the least significant bits?

1595541188
ikskuh
truncate + shift :D

1595541225
leeward
@intCast(uSmaller, v >> (bigger - smaller)) ?

1595541242
ikskuh
@truncate, but yeah :D

1595541277
ikskuh
i know that someone once build for android with zig. does anyone remember who that was?

1595541659
andrewrk
ikskuh, it was akavel

1595541670
ikskuh
thanks :)

1595541674
andrewrk


1595541677
andrewrk


1595541688
ikskuh
because dunstblick needs both a windows and an android client :D

1595541700
andrewrk
oh, I'm remembering the wrong thing. I know what you're talking about now

1595541706
andrewrk
don't remember that other person

1595541733
ikskuh
no worries

1595541736
ikskuh
i think i got enough info :)

1595541747
ikskuh
i found a nice project building a android apk without java :D

1595541753
ikskuh
which is a good starting point

1595542221
ikskuh
> Requesting permissions in the JNI "oh you have to do that in Java" or other dumb stuff like that. I am completely uninterested in your opinions of what is or is not possible. This is computer science. There aren't restrictions. I can do anything I want. It's just bits. You don't own me.

1595542223
ikskuh


1595542415
ikskuh
if i get this to compile with "zig cc" instead of the NDK clang

1595542428
ikskuh
we can build android apps with zig :D

1595545375
andrewrk
nice

1595546358
andrewrk
it's not uncommon to see a successful test output this in stage2: [info] (compiler): Update completed in 0 ms

1595546395
andrewrk
that's a debug build.
