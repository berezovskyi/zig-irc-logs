how does one export an init() method to C? I need it to return a pointer to some abstract struct that C sees

1605227431
daurnimator
teratorn: `export fn init(.....) callconv(.C) { ...... }`

1605227485
teratorn
ok, now i have an exported struct with a hashmap field, which wont compile??

1605227523
Core3159
justin_smith: since -% have wraparound semantic, -%-1 still equal -1, isn't it?

1605227532
daurnimator
teratorn: you'll have to elaborate a bit. but my hunch is that you need to use only `extern` structs in your C interfaces

1605227551
daurnimator
Core3159: yes; though note that `i1` doesn't fit `1`.

1605228518
Core3159
daurnimator: so @absCast(Uint, -%x) works , just like ~@absCast(Uint, x+% -1), right?

so this is my very first zig project, thanks all for helping me out, answering my noob questions. i am sure this code has a lot of room for improvement, hence i lay it before you, i hope some of you will provide constructive feedback:

yZ5vlALg86l, cool project

1605229495
marler8997__
inStream and outStream are deprecated, it's reader and writer now

1605229569
marler8997__
concat already exists: std.mem.concat(allocator, u8, a, b)

1605229662
marler8997__
you're using the now kinda old allocator interface, are you compiling with an old compiler?

1605229674
yZ5vlALg86lP
i still use 0.6.0

1605229694
marler8997__
0.7.0 just release, good time to update

1605229756
yZ5vlALg86lP
it's not yet in alpine edge :/

1605229799
marler8997__
I have a tool written in Zig that downloads/manages zig compilers if you're interested:

1605229810
yZ5vlALg86lP
the instream/outstream thing i mostly copied from the bearssl bindings

1605229843
yZ5vlALg86lP
i'm actually packaging stuff in alpine, i might just bump the version there...

1605229868
marler8997__
yeah, it's time for all the package managers to update anyway

1605229919
marler8997__
not sure if you want to wait for 0.7.1 though..not sure how long it will take, maybe a week or so?

1605229943
marler8997__
0.7.0 was just released, but 0.7.1 is a patch release fixing a few known issues with 0.7.0

1605229961
yZ5vlALg86lP
ah. the problem is there is no llvm11 yet in alpine...

1605230015
marler8997__
ah, well, zigup is still there for you, you may want to have it around anyway if you are doing zig development because you'll want to be able to have multiple  compilers installed and the ability to switch between them

1605230281
yZ5vlALg86lP
thanks. i cloned it, will have a look at the changed interfaces you suggested

1605232233
mla
maybe obvious but im struggling here, how do i pass options to clang in compile via zig build-exe, i want to just pass through -fno-profile-arcs

1605235665
mla
ok figured it out, using zig cc passes things through

1605241124
pfg_
mla, -cflags -fno-profile-arcs -- source.c

1605241150
pfg_
also build.zig lets you do .addCSourceFile("file.c", &[_][]const u8{"-fno-profile-arcs"});

i found a miscompilation! \o/

1605261413
alexnask[m]
Not that I know of

1605261438
alexnask[m]
ALthough, something just popped into my mind, let me look it up for a second

1605261560
alexnask[m]
Ah, I think this is what I was thinking of:

1605261580
ikskuh
i created an issue for that

1605261599
ikskuh
luckily i could reproduce it easily :Â±

1605265011
ikskuh
aaand a new PR \o/

1605271521
ikskuh
daurnimator: i think your filename[1..filename.len-1] is harder to understand

1605271528
ikskuh
it doesn't convey that much intent

1605271991
daurnimator
okay

1605272093
ikskuh
i've changed the gitignore thingy

1605272126
ikskuh
any technical objections?

1605272343
daurnimator
nope

1605272345
daurnimator
LGTM

1605272449
ikskuh
lgtm?

1605272454

looks good to me

1605272472
ikskuh
ah, thanks :)

is merge error sets lazy (merge the sets before analyzing them) or non lazy (analyze both sets first and then merge them)? what should it be?

1605288406
andrewrk
fengb, not sure if you are aware but LemonBoy just fixed an old ass bug that was making ReleaseSmall not actually do small

i'd like to take a shot at implementing astgen for continue. should it be implemented with BreakVoid?

What's the idiomatic way to convert a c string into []u8 ?

1605294983
ikskuh
std.mem.span()

1605294991
ikskuh
will return []const u8

1605295070

Wow! Thanks! :-D

Man, I'd love to help with the standard library documentation.

1605295158
g-w1
is the only reason that it doesn't work the lazy evaluation?

1605295592
andrewrk
the work has to be partially re-done in self-hosted, so I didn't push it beyond a proof-of-concept

1605295661

ah

i could also help with stdlib docs, no idea where to even begin. :D

hey all, I am trying to add line numbers to my log output so it's easier to debug, see

oh craps, sorry guys my window was scrolled up

1605299418
pfg_
demizer, @src() can tell you line numbres, I'm not sure if that's what you want

1605299469
pfg_
oh you want to get the line number without passing in something like `@src()`

1605299606
pfg_
the stacktrace you are printing is only showing the line in std.log for me and nothing else

1605299885
pfg_
demizer, try std.debug.writeCurrentStackTrace. you will then have to search through that to find the place where log was called

1605299911
pfg_
or you can use a StackIterator directly

1605299976
pfg_
that way you can get the value directly instead of writing a bunch of text out to an arraylist and searching through the arraylist to find what you want

1605300071
demizer
sweet, thanks pfg_, i'll see if i can make that work
