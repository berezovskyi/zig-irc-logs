error: expected 2 arguments, found 3      try qs.draw_command_data.init(qs.vertex_buffer_objects[0], GL_DRAW_INDIRECT_BUFFER);

1592657010
blinghound
the signature for the init function is

1592657023
blinghound
pub fn init(id: GLuint, target: GLenum) !MapBuffer(T, size)

1592657036
blinghound
does anyone have any idea why it thinks I'm passing 3 arguments in?

1592657067
blinghound
qs.vertex_buffer_objects is just a [5]GLuint

1592657127
blinghound
ah, unless it's implicitly passing self in

1592657288
blinghound
don't worry guys, I was calling the init function as a member function when it was returning a MapBuffer

1592658343
blinghound
I'm getting a ?*c_void back from the openGL call glMapBufferRange

1592658401
blinghound
is there a way to cast it to a []T if I know the amount of memory that has been allocated?

1592658432
ifreund
sure, just declare your slice as undefined then set ptr and len

1592658442
blinghound
with @ptrCast, I'm getting error: cast increases pointer alignment

1592658448
blinghound
I'll try

1592658456
ifreund
oh that's a different issue

1592658472
ifreund
you need to @alignCast() c_void as well usually

1592658519
ifreund
but you also can't cast it directly to a slice, since a slice is more than just a pointer, you need to cast it to a [*] pointer first

1592658601
ifreund
oh i think once you have the [*] ptr you can do `const my_slice = ptr[..length]`

1592658619
ifreund
which will turn the [*] ptr into a [] slice

1592658794
blinghound
ok so I get the *c_void from the glMapNamedBufferRange call

1592658810
blinghound
then I need to cast the *c_void to a [*]T?

1592658911
ifreund
yeah, something like @ptrCast([*]T, @alignCast(@alignOf([*]T), void_ptr));

1592658977
ifreund
you can also do @intToPtr([*]T, @ptrToInt(void_ptr)); which is a little less verbose

1592659513
blinghound
@ifreund thanks ifreund, I

1592659531
blinghound
although now I'm getting another issue

1592659547
blinghound
how do I format code here?

1592659564
ifreund
zig fmt file.zig

1592659575
blinghound
ah sorry I mean to send here

1592659592
ifreund
oh lol, use a pastebin of some kind, i like

1592659621
ifreund
no zig syntax highlighting yet though

I'm using this struct

1592659668
blinghound
but when I try to assign .{ .vertex_count = 4 ...etc };

1592659683
blinghound
I'm getting an error: no member named 'vertex_count' in struct ....

1592659716
ifreund
sounds strange, could you paste the code where you're doing the assignment?

1592662432
ifreund
is this out of line?

1592663218
THFKA4
i wouldn't personally waste time engaging, but the madman may actually be genuine

1592663228
THFKA4
hard to tell with these things sometimes

1592664333
ifreund
heh, looks like they were trolling

1592671844

if statement comparing strings, is mem.eql u8 "the way"?

Even during NimConf, they're talking about Zig

1592671992
mq32
:D

1592671998
mq32
everyone talks about zig!

1592672008
mq32
nerthus: yes it is!

1592677167

andrewrk on zls: "this is already pretty good"

1592677171
mq32
this is an understatement!

andrewrk
ifreund, my suggestion is to write your comments for the audience, not the person you are actually replying to. If you feel the point has already been made for an astute reader, you might not need to reply at all

1592681286

watzon: They want to use Zig as a C compiler; amusing.

I've ported my python zig update tool to zig

dom96, congrats on what looks like a successful virtual nimconf :)

1592683586
andrewrk
looks like some interesting talks

1592683636
andrewrk
marler8997, nice, that looks handy. looking at the build setup it makes me want to hurry up and get the package manager done

1592683658
marler8997
yeah feel free to use it however you like

1592684607
marler8997
andrewrk, if you like I could work on getting an initial http client into the standard lib, based on my ziget library

1592684650
marler8997
I created it to be very minimal, I think could be a good starting off point

1592684827
andrewrk
marler8997, this effort should probably be coordinated with mq32 (

1592684973
marler8997
mq32, what's the plan of action for getting an http client into the std lib? I have a minimal http client here that I've been using:

1592687303
ifreund
andrewrk: that's a good way to approach things, thanks

1592687671
andrewrk
interesting, linux does not give you EISDIR if you open a directory for read-only, and there is no flag to make it give you EISDIR

1592687735
leeward
I wonder if it's because reading directories used to give inodes.

1592687769
andrewrk
you can pass O_DIRECTORY to make it fail if it's

1592687782
leeward
Gotta stat it?

1592687823
leeward
I know it's not true on modern versions of Linux, but on older versions and most other unices you could hexdump a directory and get something useful.
