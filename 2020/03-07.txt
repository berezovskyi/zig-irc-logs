hmm, the hover doesn't seem to work for @intCast, works for hovering over a local function and for id's and such though

1583539354
metaleap
too bad

1583539357

Ah you mean `fs.readAllAlloc`

1583539376

I'm glad it's finding real problems. My biggest worry was being a site of false positives

metaleap: any way to tell it where my stdlib is?

1583539454
metaleap
wilsonk: what editor are you using btw, if vscode do you rely on some generic "lsp client" extension?

1583539526
metaleap
in the stderr logpanel for the lsp you'd see shortly after startup (or restart) after "init wiplangserver" and "enter main loop" a line like `STDLIB/home/_/a/zig/lib/zig/std` --- if detection succeeds, that is. otherwise silent nothingness as of today

1583539593
wilsonk
metaleap: vscode with the andersfr extension

1583539599
metaleap
wilsonk: no way to tell it anything right now, at the end things will be made configurable tho. it's the kind of thing i like to postpone until the full space of what could be in there is known.

1583539624
wilsonk
metaleap: yep, no problems...just curious

cool, more info here:

lots of goodies in ziglang.org referrer urls:

hey andrewrk, are you guys working on supporting llvm 10 yet?

1583546573
andrewrk
jwh, it's done in the llvm10 branch.

1583546593
jwh
oh cool

1583547731
andrewrk
llvm is going to do an rc4

1583547794
jwh
oh, thought rc3 was going to be it

1583547805
jwh
glad someone fixed aarch64 anyway :P

1583549610
mikdusan
oh nice. 21 seconds to build stage1 on llvm-10 branch. lld was costly.

andrewrk: would now be a better time?

1583555085
daurnimator
andrewrk: is there a reason a lot of the lib/std/zig/cross_target.zig functions return a [:0]u8 rather than a []u8? I don't think the call sites want null-terminated and might be an artifact of accidental use of std.Buffer

1583605661
adamkowalski
andrewrk: is there any way to "tag" unit tests and then when you run your suite only run tests with that tag? And can we generate some sort of report such as how long each test took to run, sorted from longest to shorted?

1583605755
TheLemonMan
there's the test-filter option

1583607044
adamkowalski
right but that seems to only filter tests in the first you are running

1583607055
adamkowalski
I have a main file which includes all my other tests, similar to the standard library

1583607078
adamkowalski
if you try to filter by a tag, it will run no tests, since main.zig has no tests of it's own

metaleap
is there a "downloads" archive with the n most-recent nightly binaries? current one bugs out on me with "TODO buf_write_value_bytes maybe type" but dont want to downgrade to my weeks-ago nightly

1583611276
metaleap
(this is the issue wilsonk warned me about yesterday so at least i wanna find out how-many-days-ago this regression began to show up in zig)

1583611694
jaredmm
@metaleap: I think you can download it based on the commit id.

1583611712
jaredmm
Don't know of a list, though.

1583611764
metaleap
jaredmm thx will try! funky that this whole machinery goes to town on every commit

1583611773
metaleap
but sure handy

1583611862
metaleap
(oh i see i guess commit msgs flag or unflag the process as only some have green checkmarks, ok good old ci/cd)

1583614841
metaleap
man some time in the last 10 days someone removed `error{OutOfSpace}` from some of the out-stream io stuff. was it in sliceOutStream? io/OutStream? beats me, all i know is that i relied on it for json-dumping and dynamically growing my buf until it would fit the json dump. now there's just a generic "WriteError".

1583615806
jaredmm
@metaleap: there was a commit (c81345c8aec56a108f6f98001666a1552d65ce85) that changed OutOfSpace errors to OutOfMemory errors (with a lot of other file changes).

1583615839
jaredmm
Maybe that can help you diagnose what changed and if there's a different way to handle it now.

1583615927
metaleap
jaredmm nice find, thanks! i did a search in issues and in PRs on OutOfSpace with nothing turning up, how do you grep in situations like this?

1583615987
jaredmm
If you have a working and unworking commit, you can use git bisect to narrow it down. You said 10 days, so I picked a random commit on that day and today.

1583616047
metaleap
jaredmm til thx!

1583616066
jaredmm
Git will ask you if a commit is good or bad and you have to run whatever test case you're doing to determine that, then it'll keep going until it finds the one that changed it.

1583616092
jaredmm
You could also use git log to search for a specific string (like WriteError). `git log -S'WriteError' --after="2020-02-26" -p ./lib/std` and that should do a raw string search for anything that added that text (think it only works for adds and not removes).

1583616352
jaredmm
Looks like -G'error.OutOfSpace' would work for removed ones (and uses regex rather than just a string).

1583616956
metaleap
ooh that'd be the ticket, noted

1583617682
metaleap
wilsonk through an hour or two of trial and error i drilled down the latest zig commit that still builds the wip lsp , i made an issue #4674 to track that zig regression

1583617997
metaleap
andrewrk: so if i read

1583622640
wilsonk
metaleap sorry I was afk. Checked out the issue. I can't see anything off hand that would cause that issue, but hopefully someone else with more experience can eyeball it.

1583622653
metaleap
fingers crossed
