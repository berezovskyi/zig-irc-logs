andrewrk: you moved to Phoenix?

1591661701
gonz_
Is Phoenix on average the hottest place in the US?

1591661709
gonz_
It seems like the closest thing to hell on earth

1591661726
fengb
Eh it’s close, but Nevada is hotter

1591661728
gonz_
WRT to temperatures

1591661748
fengb
I think? I forget where the worst of the desert is

1591661758
fengb
Definitely around those parts

1591661809
fengb
Although the dry heat isn’t actually as awful as the swampy southeast

1591661829
gonz_
Every year I see some insane video from Phoenix (or perhaps neighboring AZ towns) where they do some insane thing like pour water that instantly evaporates on manhole covers

1591661853
gonz_
And I'm like "Why did anyone ever settle there?"

1591661942
gchristensen
"it's a dry heat"

1591662443
gonz_
We usually get like 35C/95F here which is already bordering on too damn hot

1591662464
gonz_
I can't even imagine these 110+F temperatures people get

1591662493
fengb
At some point, you don’t feel like it gets much hotter >_>

1591662504
gonz_
Because you die?

1591662514
fengb
(I don’t know if that’s true. I’m just making shit up)

1591662837
gonz_
I'll literally never find out the truth about this regardless, hopefully.

1591662866
gonz_
Though we went to Morocco when I was 12 and it was hot as shit there too; I don't know how hot.

1591663436
tgschultz
Is there a reason TypeInfo.Fn.return_type is nullable?

1591663547
andrewrk
yeah, I'm spending some time with my family. dealing with some personal stuff

1591664023
fengb
Oh I hope everything is okay

1591664146
leeward
gonz_: Death Valley is the hottest place in the US.

1591664188
gonz_
So it's not that far away from AZ, then?

1591664254
leeward
Not super far away. For what it's worth, deserts are way more pleasant at 35C than humid places at 30.

1591664420
leeward
Ooh, I have a friend who lives in Chelmsford. I'll have to ask if he's metasyntactic.

1591665090
gonz_
Maybe there should be a Zig shibboleth so that you can ask without asking.

1591665096
gonz_
And feel sneaky and cool.

1591665189
leeward
That Ziggy sure is funny and not a method for the CIA to send messages to field operatives.

1591665224
leeward
Possibly too us-centric; not sure if Ziggy is syndicated anywhere else.

1591665260
gonz_
The only Ziggy I know is from The Wire :D

1591665680
leeward
Ah, I meant Zippy.

1591665796
gonz_
To be clear, don't take my ignorance as indication that you're misremembering. I grew up on US media, but I'm from Sweden.

1591665929
leeward
No, I was misremembering. Zippy is a syndicated comic strip in the US that rarely makes any sense.

1591665968
fengb
God damnit Ziggy

1591666059
andrewrk
every once in a while I get an email about the Zip programming language

1591666090
leeward
Google things I mistyped zig when I search for that.

1591666097
leeward
Er, duckduckgo does, actually.

1591666218
gonz_
If I remember correctly I actually ended up on the ziglang page because I was searching for Nim at the time

1591666223
gonz_
and I remembered I had seen something about it

1591666225
gonz_
and here we are

1591666448
gonz_
andrewrk: Is the FreeBSD tier 2 status more severe than the Windows one?

1591666830
daurnimator
ikskuh: what is data source? I'm not on the map?

1591666854
leeward
daurnimator: You are the data source!

1591666908
fengb
I’d be pretty creepy if you pop up automatically

1591666929
gonz_
The NSA is like "Here's everyone who uses Zig, by the way... You're welcome."

1591666941
daurnimator
oh i thought it was from twitch/youtube/github/irc stats or something

1591669607
andrewrk
gonz_,

1591669895
daurnimator
freebsd domains are failing to resove for me....

1591671427

works fine for me

1591671470
daurnimator
up again.

1591724333

ZeeMaps says the map is frozen :/

1591724348

We got more than 100 visits, I guess.

the talk on ZLS is pretty cool

1591725226

Link?

contribution idea: someone could look into making std.HashMap use array of keys, array of values, rather than array of entries. it's a breaking change but could possibly have some nice perf improvements

1591726402
andrewrk
std.HashMap would be a nice benchmark to add to ziglang/gotta-go-fast

1591728622
scientes
andrewrk, should I submit my gnuhash implementation?

1591728629
scientes
I didn't use it for anything however

1591728644
scientes
but I was thinking of implementing the ELF bloom filter

1591728655
scientes
it is just so simple however

1591728668
scientes
(gnuhash that is)

1591728677
scientes
it was too fast to benchmark

1591728685
scientes
even with @fence(.SeqCst)

1591730302
shcv
I see a Base64 lib in std; what about other base encodings?

1591730323
shcv
or would there be interest in a more generic encoding facility?

1591730338
leeward
It's really good at Base2.

1591730363
leeward
I thought I read something about other bases a little while ago. Let me see if I can find it.

1591730614
ifreund
so, to "clear" an ArrayList can I just set items.len to 0?

1591730680
alexnask
Yes

1591730745
ifreund
cool

1591730830
opDispatch
Base85

1591730862
opDispatch
somewhat used but much less than 64 of course

1591730869
opDispatch
aka "z85"

1591732567
shcv
can't say I've seen it before, but no reason a generic facility couldn't support it

1591732599
shcv
just provide 85 symbols and configure any padding...

1591734083
leeward
Time for a kernel update. That's a long vulnerability list.

1591736951
bgiannan
do people use ZLS in sublime ?

1591736966
bgiannan
zig doesn show up in the list when i do 'Enable Language Server'

1591737232
ifreund
bgiannan: i dont, but iirc there are directions for sublime in the ZLS readme

1591737318
bgiannan
i followed those without success

1591738093
alexnask
Have you installed the "Zig Langugae" extension?

1591738284
bgiannan
i did

1591738344
bgiannan
when i do 'restart servers' i get 'language server zig has crashed ...'

1591738402
bgiannan
oh wait it works

1591738407
bgiannan
needed to restart sublime

1591738424
alexnask
Huh weird

1591738512
bgiannan
also the contextual LSP menu entries are all greyed out

1591738606
alexnask
Like goto definition etc.? I will try sublime text to debug this (ive tested on vscode, emacs, kakoune and nvim with coc with success tho)

1591738754
bgiannan
yes those entries

1591738783
bgiannan
but when i hover on a symbol it shows me the definition

1591738871
alexnask
I assume completions work as well? Weird we tell the client that we support goto definition. Probably some sublime lsp quirkiness but I will figure it out :)

1591739452
bgiannan
yes completion works

1591746130
pixelherodev
leeward: what list?
