when i download one of the prebuilt releases, does the zig binary need to live with the stuff in `lib`?

betawaffle: that's right, the lib directory needs to stay at the same relative path to the zig binary

I think it checks ./lib, ../lib, and so on. At least I can keep it in .local/lib with the executable in .local/bin

i'm trying to get the latest on nixos

1607273616
betawaffle
if anyone has an existing setup for that, let me know

i would probably use zigup and then run `zigup master` to get the latest

i had a shell.nix around somewhere that built the new zig version by overriding the source attr

you probably want a newer commit than that, but should work otherwise

betawaffle: ^^

1607275133
betawaffle
yep, that's what i ended up with

1607275185
dutchie
i should probably also take another look at

though at this point maybe it would be easier to just wait for 0.7.1

I have a line, `const mode_a: bool = std.mem.eql(u8, build_options.mode, "mode_a");` which is not doing what I expect. When I print out build_options.mode, it says "mode_a" but when I print mode_a, it's false. This used to work circa 1.6 and now doesn't. Anyone know why?

that sounds kinda freaky :/

It does, doesn't it?

1607298273

Oh, and it's comptime so I can't just gdb the executable.

1607298381
ifreund
are you sure there's no whitespace in build_options.mode?

1607298411
ifreund
@compileLog() of the raw bytes of both might shed some light

1607298442
leeward
Hah, there are quotes.

1607298453
leeward
Not sure how that happened.

1607298475
ifreund
heh

1607298482
leeward
build_options.name is `"mode_a"`

1607298509
leeward
but in my build.zig, it's assigned as...yep, b.fmt("\"{}\", .{name})

Guess I was working around a bug that's since been fixed.

1607298718

Anyone know if there's been any progress on msp430 since I last checked in...October?

Looks like the list says it's still tier 4.
