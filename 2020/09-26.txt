this will be my last big push on self-hosted until the release. until then I'll be working on helping other people get their PRs landed, giving some love to issues, and doing other prep for the release

Hi everyone,

hi Tallin

1601139701
Tallin
I was wondering if there is a more exhaustive installation / setup description for windows. I am no C/C++ programmer and I have difficulties getting zig to run on windows. I downloaded zig from

1601139701
Tallin
knowledge. But I'm kinda lost on how to proceed to get zig running...

1601139735
Tallin
I saw the description on github

1601139868
ifreund
hmm, I personally haven't used windows in years but I can try and be of help. Don't think you should need VS installed, just zig and a text editor

1601139897
ifreund
can you open up a terminal and navigate to the directory you downloaded zig to?

1601139930
Tallin
Will it be enough if I add the zig.exe from the downloaded file to my systems search path?

1601139958
ifreund
yeah that's probably fine

1601139976
Tallin
thanks I will try that

1601139979
ifreund
as long as you can type e.g. `zig version` in a termial and get output

1601140005
Tallin
thank you for the help ill try zig version once i altered the path

1601140053
ifreund
once you can run zig, then do `zig init-exe` in an empty directory which will generate a hello world project

1601140068
ifreund
then you can do `zig build run` to compile and run the hello world

1601140176
Tallin
alright i will try that. `zig version` is working now thank you

1601140288

is it possible to use a struct with a generic comptime value in a function signature

1601147093
joey152
I am  trying to get something like this working:

1601147117
joey152
where the alignment is irrelavant to the function

1601147512
joey152
maybe not irrelavant but it should be able to be inferred

was not bad until the last redesign to be "modern"

1601161716
pixelherodev
Maybe not, but I like the proposed redesign more than

1601161719

iterations*

1601161838
Sahnvour
I find the flat design too cluttered, also no separator anywhere to guide the eye

imo it started getting off the rails when he said that seeing the last commit to touch a specific file in the tree was useless

1601161873
Sahnvour
torque: yeah I mean I can see the point, but it's actually useful in practice

Good evening everyone,

1601162047
Tallin
I am wondering how I can print an array to see how it looks at runtime. I have to following code but get an error when compliling that the expected type does not match

1601162049
Tallin
const print = @import("std").debug.print;pub fn main() void {    const Origin = @embedFile("cars.csv");    print(Origin, .{});}

1601162063
Tallin
```const print = @import("std").debug.print;pub fn main() void {    const Origin = @embedFile("cars.csv");    print(Origin, .{});}```

1601162135
lunamn
you can print("{}", .{Origin});, should work

1601162432
Tallin
thank you that works

1601162457
Tallin
i dont even understand how print works yet xD
