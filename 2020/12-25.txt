Does this look right?

g-w1
ahhh, I spent like 10 hours trying to debug a memory leak, and then with like 20 mins just reading the diff of my changes I found it immediatly! Now my pull requests are unblocked!

heya

1608908617
ikskuh
is variadic function cimpor known to be broken? or is this a new bug of the changes to translate-c?

1608908797
ifreund
ikskuh: I've successfully called @cImport()'ed varargs functions before, not sure if that works on the lastest zig though

1608908854
ikskuh


1608908862
ikskuh
fresh from translate-c

1608908907
ifreund
oh stuff like that has probably never worked

1608908954
ifreund
that would require support for defining C ABI vardaic functions not just calling them

1608909054
ikskuh
ifreund: it has! that's from the SDL2 headers

1608909068
ikskuh
but now it doesn't compile anymore

1608909086
ifreund
translate-c change then I guess

1608909092
ikskuh
yeah

1608909101
ikskuh
switching from extern fn to fn() callconv(.C)

1608909105
ifreund
you should able to trivially work around it by manually translating that function

1608909118
ikskuh
well

1608909127
ikskuh
i don't want to manually translate-c the SDL headers D

1608909136
ikskuh
that function is

1608909145
ifreund
oh I see

1608909186
ikskuh
the backtrace is … weird

1608909244
ikskuh


1608909264
ikskuh
something is calling a refalldecls i assume

1608909431
ikskuh
huh

1608909433
ikskuh
broke since 0.7.1

1608909535
ifreund
ikskuh: probably this:

1608909699
ikskuh
yeah, could be it

1608909700
ikskuh
:O

1608909914
g-w1
is "||=" a valid operand (assign merge error set)? it works in stage1, but is not in stage2 so zig fmt wont parse it, but it will compile. should I remove it from stage1, or add to stage2?

1608909928
g-w1
*not operand but assign operator

1608909941
ikskuh
imho we can remove it. i never used it…

1608909948
ikskuh
is it documented to exist? :D

1608909951
ifreund
woah that exists?

1608909955
ikskuh
if not, it's an implementation bug :D

1608909965
ifreund
no it's not in the docs or PEG grammer

1608909983
g-w1
I was just reading the ast_render.cpp code, and found it

1608909990
g-w1
ill remove it

1608910096
ikskuh
:D

1608910105
ikskuh
g-w1: btw, wonderful PRs! <3

1608910115
ikskuh
i see you added @compileLog to stage2?

1608910201
g-w1
yep, I figured it would be needed for debugging, and also had to make a decl have multiple errors since compileLog doesn't stop analysis

1608910830
ikskuh
hehe, yeah

1608910838
ikskuh
@compileLog is a wonderful debugging tool

1608911091
ikskuh
wat, someone started Haiku support? sweet

1608913878
g-w1
why is src passed around as a usize in stage2 even though the max source size is (2 * (1024 ** 3)) (2**31)? this seems not correct because if a system has a pointer size of <u31, something bad would happen, but on 64 bit systems, usize is using double the memory it should be (u31)

1608914449
ikskuh
properly including SDL2 into build.zig feels like the same amount of work as just building it and all dependencies from source

1608914553
ifreund
g-w1: why is that the maximum value?

1608914683
g-w1
2 gb (main.zig:29)

1608914790
ifreund
ok well if a the pointer size is less than 32 bits then it wont compile

1608914832
ifreund
I'm not sure if using a u32 instead of a usize would be worth it here. It would certainly be less ergonomic

1608914844
ifreund
I feel like doing that now would be premature optimization

1608914950
g-w1
yeah, especially with #6624

1608914954
g-w1
just wondering

1608915707
ikskuh
hm. compiler-rt for i386-windows-gnu seems to be missing ___chkstk_ms?

1608919453
ikskuh
g-w1: git commit -m "foo " || = "from stage1"

1608919457
ikskuh
are two commands :D

1608919462
ikskuh
git commit

1608919470
ikskuh
and if that fails, "=" is executed :D

1608919478
ikskuh
you need to escape \"||=\"  in the string

1608919671
g-w1
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, it was the fault of bash

1608919824
ikskuh
yeah

1608922199
ikskuh
heya

1608922207
ikskuh
anyone here using github actions + zig + compile with msvc?

1608922217
ikskuh
i'm struggling with setting up the SDK correcty

1608925599
pixelherodev
g-w1: ouch, I know that

1608925707
torque
this is why lord linux torvalds himself invented $EDITOR

1608925843
pixelherodev
... Linux Torvalds?

1608927903
g-w1
which feeling, debugging for 10 hrs and then reading the diff for 20 mins and finding bug, or bash being weird with quotes?

1608927954
pixelherodev
Yes
