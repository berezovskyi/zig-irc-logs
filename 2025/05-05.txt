Hello -- why I am I getting a "does not declare a preferred optimization mode" message despite declaring one and including it with my module and executable build steps? https://paste.sr.ht/~smlavine/89adab2fc142035fb988f6d66415384af147e40c

--release overrides preferred_optimize_mode, the name is misleading https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/19732
