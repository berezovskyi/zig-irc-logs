rvrb: is your trace thing something that would be useful to debug the http test failures in https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/pulls/30033 ? they're reproducible for me on my machine

andrewrk: my head is deep in what I was just working on, so I'm not grokking the specifics, but maybe?

if it's a race, you could in theory set a SpanUserdata/traceFn that assigns a monotonic ID to each span, and a logFn that checks `std.log.current_span.userdata.id` or whatever field you set in the userdata and puts it in the log format string, and do some print debugging

I _think_ the spans will play nicely even if you throw some inside the Io implementation itself, at least if I coded it correctly

the traceFn in my PR has output that looks like this: https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/pulls/30006#issuecomment-8620509

you could reuse logic in your logFn with whatever symbols you want and get a timeline

hi everyone. Does anyone know the state of SIMD in the self-hosted Zig compiler? I'm wanting to compile SIMD wasm from wasm.
