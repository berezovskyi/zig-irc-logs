zig build "test step whatever" | less doesn't page. I can't output in a file neither using 2>&1 >out, so how do I check the top of my build/tests if it goes out of my tty screen? I am kind of cheating today and I am sshing to my box and that's why

Drixtan: Order matters with io redirects and | only does stdout by default, not stderr. Try `|& less` or `>out 2>&1` instead.

Hello, I have an Image struct with {width: u32, height: u32, data: []Color} where Color is {r:u8, g:u8 b:u8} I would like to be able to change data "dynamicly" so img.data[0].g = 255 for instance. I'm not sure if []Color is the right type (should myabe be [*]Color) I try to init it with             .data = &[_]Color{ .{} } ** (width * height),           witch works when the type is []const Color

instead but then I can't modify data. Anyway I don't really know what should be done here (if my question is clear ?)

tonitch!~tonitch@user/tonitch
the error is ppm.zig|20 col 34| error: expected type '[]ppm.Color', found '*const [100]ppm.Color'

||             .data = &[_]Color{ .{} } ** (width * height),

Ok sorry for that long question I found the solution. I have to allocate the memory. I though it was possible without it.

JetpackJackson: you can just ask the question, and maybe someone with overlapping knowledge can help, or point you in the right direction

im currently trying to modify https://github.com/tassoevan/avr-arduino-zig to work with a nano instead of an uno cause i dont wanna fry my board

1751318790
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
but then i get a bunch of errors

1751318797
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson

thats my zig build output

1751319187
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
i tried to use regz to generate the files for the atmega328 but then i decided i should see if i can get it to compile without changes

1751319187
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
did you try compiling it without modifying it?

1751319202
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
lemme reset it completely then ig

1751319219
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
i think it needs 0.13.0 tho and i wanted to use at least 0.14.0

1751319302
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
ok it compiles with 0.13.0 but thats for the uno

1751319351
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
alright the issue happens when i try to compile with 0.14.1

1751319366
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
so something changed inbetween those two versions

1751319521
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
so like how do i fix it

1751319543
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
and then how can i have it properly use the atmega328 files that got generated

1751319565
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
cause microzig doesnt have a 0.13.0 release i dont think

1751319590
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
wait hmmm

1751319602
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
microzig says it needs zig 0.14.1

1751319622
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
yeah but im looking at the old releases

1751319627
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
so I'm confused now conf

1751319633
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
and wondering if i can fetch that

1751319636
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
sorry

1751319645
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
im trying to change too much at once

1751319662
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
i want to 1. make it target the nano and 2. use a different zig version

1751319687
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
maybe i should just look at what microzig says to do to start a project

1751319994
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
ok this might take a while, its fetching deps and i think its fetching the atpack folder of data for boards

1751322325
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
https://paste.debian.net/1383648/ alright still get errors
