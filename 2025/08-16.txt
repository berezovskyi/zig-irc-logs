oh radicle has made some serious progress since last time I looked

1755332566
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
cool

1755334268
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
their protocol docs are pretty well written: https://radicle.xyz/guides/protocol

1755334288
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
I don't see anything about moderation tools though, which is a bit worrying

1755334647
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
I guess the current moderation story is just "you can add malicious nodes to a blocklist"

1755334663
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
which isn't sufficient in a peer-to-peer network IMO

1755334704
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
also no windows support currently, not that I care personally but perhaps an issue for zig

1755334990
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
hmm, the private/selectively revealing repository thing basically flips the blocklist to an allowlist

1755335007
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
perhaps an invite tree kind of thing could be built on that, but it's not something they support out of the box

1755335100
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
It also seems to lack CI integration features, though I think it provides the primitives needed for a third party to implement them on top

isn't radicle a cryptocoin?

1755363827
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
backed by a crypto company apparently, yes

1755363871
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
what I've read yesterday is "since it's open source, if the shit hits the fan, a fork can exist" (I paraphrase here)

1755363925
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
Drixtan: I'm not sure I agree with that assertion

1755364011
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
well, give yourself a shot at changing some people's mind. For my part, I am asking myself the benefits of _all of this_ in the first place, how much will it slow the progress of zig... but I am only on the "customer side" of things...

1755364190
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I've been thinking off and on for a clever and elegant way to put issue/diff/comment data into git for over 2 years now... I haven't come up with anything (other than committing flat md files) I'm gonna feel really embarrased if you come up with something better in a weekend

1755364259
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I'm circling the conclusion that git is not designed to be the format for comment threads

1755364320
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
yea, that's another thing that leaves me wondering, - why git ? - From all the databanks available, why - this one - ? 

1755364402
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
because really, git is a **very** well designed system, and has a well constructed graph, and the graph feels like it should map well to comment threads

1755364646
hadronized!~hadronize@2001:41d0:a:fe76::1
wt, is it open-source? where can I find the code of the nodes / instances?

1755364661
hadronized!~hadronize@2001:41d0:a:fe76::1
oh, onâ€¦ radicle, :D

1755364905
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
grayhatter, I see the whole thing a little bit as forums: issues = issue forum. Diff (patches) are within the issue thread, the patch can be saved in whatever (db, on disk, cdn), the comments, well... guess what

1755364929
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
and there is alreayd a forum out there for zig

1755364978
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
pretty sure we can import gh data we want into the forums as archive 

1755365010
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
and for rvrb wanting to continue the "support from gh", well, it will move to the official forum

1755365839
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
Drixtan: threads are a better atomic unit in this context

1755365921
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
you can treat everything as a thread, and depending on the context direction you want, you can then attach a thread to an issue, or a diff, or a commit

1755366070
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
that's kinda how it works (optionally) in srctree, where you'd create an issue (thread), have a conversation, attach a diff/patch to that issue, continue the conversation, and then when you commit that patch to master, the thread goes with it, if you view the commit, that same thread is listed along side the commit.

iacore!~iacore@5.180.78.35
I think minicoro (https://github.com/edubart/minicoro/blob/main/minicoro.h) is a good reference implementation for coroutine support in the language. Did anyone bring this up before?

1755370181
blurrycat!~blurrycat@user/blurrycat
Is it possible in 0.14.1 to create a custom format function for a @Vector() type? Like if I define `const Vec3 = @Vector(3, f64)`, can I have a custom formatting function to be able to print it using `{f}`?

1755370231
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
{f} thing is in 0.15 afaik

1755370374
blurrycat!~blurrycat@user/blurrycat
ah you're right, I meant `{}` instead, I mixed things up a bit 

1755370487
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
so basically, your question is, can you make a function that returns an array of u8 so you can {s} it?

1755370647
blurrycat!~blurrycat@user/blurrycat
I would prefer not having to allocate if possible, I guess I could just make a function that writes directly to a Writer instead

1755370774
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
function_name(buf: []u8 <-- pass the buffer from the stack 

1755370840
blurrycat!~blurrycat@user/blurrycat
that would also be a solution yeah

1755372825
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.229
I can't imagine anyone would seriously consider moving the GH issue archive into Discourse. anyways, you're putting words in my mouth. I did not propose continuing 'support from GitHub', I was emphasizing the value of the metadata surrounding GitHub issues, and that careful consideration should be put into maintaining that valuable trove of

1755372826
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.229
knowledge.

1755373086
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.229
there's a hell of a lot more to community/knowledge management than pattern matching a threaded data model to a piece of software.

1755373189
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
rvrb, I didn't say you wanted to move into discorse or whatesoever. You said something like you liked the support you received on gh and that would have to move to another platform (and in the flow of the conversation, where I talked about a hypothetical forum solution) like a forum

1755373203
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
so tell me where I've put words into yur mouth like you are saying

1755375467
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I couldn't agree more with rvrb's take! IME it's impossible to maintain perfect continuity migrating from or to any [platform]. Thus when sacrifices are made, it's much easier to discard or degrade information, and that's always been a mistake felt "forever"

1755375519
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
so, what are you suggesting? keep gh ?

1755375708
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I don't think it's a reasonable conclusion to say, "because don't want to lose or degrade any of the valuable information/metadata, we must continue using github"

Did zig fetch lose its ability to fetch a specific branch using #branch-name at the end of the url?

(On the latest master)

1755376095

ok, that discussion is going no where
