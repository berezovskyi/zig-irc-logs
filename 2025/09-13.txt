am i doing something wrong? when i try to debug my zig code in VSCODE with lldb the breakpoints just ignore if, else return and keep going down and im build the binary with -Doptimize=Debug

so just an update: json with defaults took about 18s to save json but it was over 200m and was incomplete.  zon takes about 15s to save the zon, which has about 200m and looks good, but loading fails with ParseZon (fromZoirNode()) after about 60s

so while zon/json would definitely be a great candidate for smaller files,   i guess it can't be too surprising that in case like mine, arrays with 100s of thousand of small, mostly int-like objects, with some moderate amount of strindata, a custom binary format outperforms both

(takes 786ms to save and 1346ms to parse, and the file has 40m -- which is actually pretty much the same size as the csv data)
