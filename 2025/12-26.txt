it seems to work if i add a systemIntegrationOption with the same name to my own build.zig - is that right?

oh i don't even have to do that?

iterm2 recently add terminal progress bar support, which zine and zig both support. My issue is that when stopping these with ^C they don't reset the terminal progress bar status, leaving the progress bar "throbbing" until I close the tab

Does anyone else here use iterm2 or are all Zig users on Ghostty now?

Also, is there an open issue for Zig using relative paths for debug info on mac?

I presume this is what's happening, I only get paths in the stack trace if I run the binary in the source directory

Which is very annoying for debugging programs where the executable depends on working directory (rsync'd everything to my linux machine and rebuilt to get a stack trace :/)

it seems that file readers/writers maintain their own offset and use pwrite/pread, so how is the underlying file offset and seekTo() on a std.fs.File used?

hi! getting "'Io' has no member named 'Threaded'" error in "Example 1" of https://andrewkelley.me/post/zig-new-async-io-text-version.html

has something changed in std.Io since then?

Does Zig have some kinda of c variadic args or Go `...` as field from function?

mimivalsi!~mimivalsi@user/MimiValsi
If does not, maybe create a sort of array/slice?

mimivalsi: have you looked at how std.debug.print works?

1766783492
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
the idiomatic Zig way is is to use a tuple like that

ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
C ABI varargs are also supported for C interop

ifreund: But ofc the debug.print... Forgot that one. Thx
