Just wait until you fuzz the code and compare it with the std.unicode result.

clevor!sid649024@id-649024.hampstead.irccloud.com
It would be nice if you could fuzz with values that aren't just u8 slices.

grayhatter: I didn't say any of std.unicode is deprecated

1745720903
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
andrewrk: I know you didn't but you said it'd likely get rewritten, and a few of the functions claim they've been deprecated because they're dangerous 

1745721229
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I also saw your lobsters comment and... uh, I think "I apprecated it" captures the idea I'm going for?

Might be interesting to email him and see if he has any advice? That thought came about out of curiosity, about what you [rhetoricial you] might be able to learn, because I've made the joke to a friend "andrewrk doesn't scale". And I've yet to figure out the imperfect thing myself

1745725205
clevor!sid649024@id-649024.hampstead.irccloud.com
andrewrk scales, but the rate is constant because he is only one person, at least I think he is. If not, then which side of andrewrk am I looking at?

1745725283
clevor!sid649024@id-649024.hampstead.irccloud.com
Maybe he scales like SiIvaGunner.

1745726670
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
clevor: I think you and I define scales inversly

Haskell coders create the papers ZigZag smokes.

I don't smoke, so if I were high, that would imply something really bad happened. Either that, or the medication I have been prescribed had side effects.

how can i seek a file to check if there exists a particular array of bytes?

1745729346
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
how can you seek a file? or find a string within a file?

1745729363
sunflr!~sunflr@user/sunflr
yeah basically that

1745729435
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
depends on how long long the search string is, read the file, std.mem.indexOf()

1745729500
sunflr!~sunflr@user/sunflr
do i have to read the whole file tho?

1745729515
sunflr!~sunflr@user/sunflr
i mean it probably won't be that big anyway i guess

1745729594
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
no, you only have to read until you find the string

1745729613
sunflr!~sunflr@user/sunflr
ooh

1745729624
sunflr!~sunflr@user/sunflr
haven't thought about that yet :P

1745729717
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
stdlib has a Boyer-Moore-Horspool implementation you could try to duplicate if you're so inclined 

1745729732
sunflr!~sunflr@user/sunflr
i dunno x3

1745729739
sunflr!~sunflr@user/sunflr
i'll try something

1745729842
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
good luck :)

thanks :3

is there a way to read a file but not seek it?

1745739261
sunflr!~sunflr@user/sunflr
std.fs.file.readall reads and seeks into a buffer but i only need to read it

1745739276
sunflr!~sunflr@user/sunflr
unless seeking back is the way to do it

1745739367
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
how does the file know where to read if you don't tell it?

1745739887
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
sunflr, are you talking about how reading makes the tell() move its position? maybe you are wanting preadvAll this way you manually give it offset 

1745739942
sunflr!~sunflr@user/sunflr
hmm interesting

1745739974
sunflr!~sunflr@user/sunflr
oh i think what i made works :O

1745740155
sunflr!~sunflr@user/sunflr
i just can't figure out how to stop the loop at the end of the file

1745746944
bw!sid2730@user/betawaffle
I kinda wish I could build a switch with comptime data, rather than relying on the optimizer to recognize an inline loop as a switch

1745747031
bw!sid2730@user/betawaffle
But given the current state of things, is there anything I should do to help the optimizer recognize my intent?

1745747146
bw!sid2730@user/betawaffle
Basically I want the semantics of a switch (get the optimizer to decide the best way to dispatch to the branches), rather than dictating a jump table, binary search, etc

1745763483
clevor!sid649024@id-649024.hampstead.irccloud.com

andrewrk: Have you heard of [Andrewrok Archives]( https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkqy5Gbj1w3FGFdSqI7ajCw )? If you have any copies of livestreams not on there, sending copies to the channel creator would help preserve them.

And also, why Vimeo and not Peertube?
