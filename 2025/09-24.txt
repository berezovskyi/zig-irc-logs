Has anyone ever had any issues with running Zig binaries in AWS Fargate? It segfaults only when running in Fargate with the `stage2_c` backend inside `sha2.zig`

The same container image running elsewhere works completely fine

deevus: make sure you are compiling for the correct target CPU (not the default of "native" if you're copying the binaries to a different machine and running them there)

does creating a function checking if str1[i] == str2[i] could be a valid string compare in zig?

mimivalsi: if you mean within a for loop? yeah, probably

I'd suggest reading some of the code in std.mem std.mem.eql, std.mem.startsWith, and std.mem.indexOf are all very common functions to compare strings

arf! I missed that. I knew I saw eql somewhere but didn't found it

1758745660

and there's even with lexical order

If it still adds something and they're still in the channel, why not?

Unless, of course, it's discouraged here.

i guess

mimivalsi: "does creating a function checking if str1[i] == str2[i] could be a valid string compare" my map parser checks the second character of a type declaration (20 or so characters) because they're all prefixed with the same string

1758754548
lemons!~doggie@user/doggie-:49517
it can be /area/sometypedef, /turf/..., /obj/..., or /mob/... and through that alone i can already vaguely categorize in which data structure to put what

1758754580
lemons!~doggie@user/doggie-:49517
i guess my point being it completely depends on the usecase

1758754669
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
hey, if it suffices as a perfect hash function, it works!

1758755197
lemons!~doggie@user/doggie-:49517
Affliction: hah, indeed
