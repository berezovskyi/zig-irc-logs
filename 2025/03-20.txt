is it more typical to specify `fn foo() !bar`, or to be explicit about the error unions you expect your function to return? I noticed in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvSeLgL4NNQ (nice video btw) that he explicitly specified the OutOfMemory that his function might return, and it got me thinking what's most typical

1742434560
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
also congrats on 0.14 release!

1742434687
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
explicit error sets are more precise but also more verbose and less flexible so they're more work to maintain

1742434715
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
if you're writing a function that is an interface someone else uses, it's better to have a specific error set

1742434727
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
e.g. library code

Does anyone know how to use std.compress.gzip.decompressor ? 

1742445910
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
dsal: with the reader/writer interface?

1742445928
dsal!sid13060@id-13060.lymington.irccloud.com
Yeah, it looks like I could just stick it inline with my file reader, but it's not happy about that.

1742446031
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
dsal: why not?

1742446153
dsal!sid13060@id-13060.lymington.irccloud.com
I'm slightly confused.  I have some code that's opening a file with `openFile` which yields a `std.fs.File.Reader`.  I'm using that interface and calling `readUntilDelimiterOrEof` which is fine.  I'm trying to stick a `decompressor` in there which is documented to return the same type as its parameter, but it complains that I can't call `readUntilDelimiterOrEof`

1742446487
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
so... the file data is compressed right?

1742446498
dsal!sid13060@id-13060.lymington.irccloud.com
I'm just trying to get the program to compile.

1742446514
dsal!sid13060@id-13060.lymington.irccloud.com
It's working on uncompressed data.  I want to to have it work on compressed data.

1742446515
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
which means the delimiter may or may not exist in the file, becuase it could be compressed?

1742446555
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
you have to give the raw reader to the decompressor, and then get an AnyReader from the decompressor

1742446599
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
oh, the decompressor has that function. I need to see your code then

1742446625
dsal!sid13060@id-13060.lymington.irccloud.com
OK, yeah.  I misread part of the signature.  The docs for Decompressor don't show any methods which is a little confusing.

1742446649
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.compress.flate.inflate.Decompressor

1742446671
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
are you using the reader() fn there?

1742446834
dsal!sid13060@id-13060.lymington.irccloud.com
Yeah, I forgot that.  But now that I have that, I'm getting an error that's not in any of my code so that's more confusing.  Trying to figure out what it's telling me.

1742447093
dsal!sid13060@id-13060.lymington.irccloud.com
It's telling me:  /nix/store/rinia2aazl4ba2q9lvmbkzzvf3dx82k0-zig-0.14.0/lib/zig/std/compress/flate/bit_reader.zig:41:37: error: type '*io.GenericReader(fs.File,error{InputOutput,AccessDenied,BrokenPipe,SystemResources,OperationAborted,LockViolation,WouldBlock,ConnectionResetByPeer,ProcessNotFound,Unexpected,IsDir,ConnectionTimedOut,NotOpenForReading,SocketNotConnected,Canceled},(function 'read'))' has no members

1742447127
dsal!sid13060@id-13060.lymington.irccloud.com
Which makes me think I'm calling it incorrectly.  I've opened a file and I'm passing it a pointer to `var fr = file.reader()`

1742447156
dsal!sid13060@id-13060.lymington.irccloud.com
i.e.:      var fr = file.reader();    var reader = std.compress.gzip.decompressor(&fr).reader();

1742447173
dsal!sid13060@id-13060.lymington.irccloud.com
Working code has `var reader = file.reader();`

1742447346
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I need the full stack trace

1742447374
dsal!sid13060@id-13060.lymington.irccloud.com
That's all it gave me.  I'll try making a toy program.

1742447439
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
it gave you that single line, and freference-trace had nothing?

1742447444
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
seems doubtful

1742447456
sp2!uid197664@user/meow/sp2
it looks like you need to pass the reader by value instead of by pointer

1742447531
dsal!sid13060@id-13060.lymington.irccloud.com
If I pass it by value, it complains differently:  src/root.zig:124:52: error: expected type '*compress.flate.inflate.Inflate(.gzip,u64,io.GenericReader(fs.File,error{InputOutput,AccessDenied,BrokenPipe,SystemResources,OperationAborted,LockViolation,WouldBlock,ConnectionResetByPeer,ProcessNotFound,Unexpected,IsDir,ConnectionTimedOut,NotOpenForReading,SocketNotConnected,Canceled},(function 'read')))', found '*const

1742447553
sp2!uid197664@user/meow/sp2
huh, i '

1742447556
sp2!uid197664@user/meow/sp2
i'm probably wrong then

1742447600
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
yeah because calling `decompressor().reader()` makes the `decompressor()` segment const

1742447620
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
if you want a var, it needs it's own var space

1742447645
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
`var decompressor = ....decompressor(file_reader);`

1742447685
dsal!sid13060@id-13060.lymington.irccloud.com
Oh yeah, that did it.

1742448234
dsal!sid13060@id-13060.lymington.irccloud.com
Cool.  Other than `aborting due to recursive panic` my code's working great.  :)

1742450173
dsal!sid13060@id-13060.lymington.irccloud.com
I was segfaulting from storing the `d.reader().any()` and trying to use it later.

1742473524
netvor!~netvor@2a00:ca8:a1f:cd0:ffd0:4958:433f:8228
it's such a testament to The Zen of Zig, when after some experimentation, shaking apis around, i end up moving this last little function to a module .. and turns out there already is the same exact function, with only one difference being a newline after `while ... |v|` :D

1742473553
netvor!~netvor@2a00:ca8:a1f:cd0:ffd0:4958:433f:8228
it's not even that i already wrote it before, but that i wrote it *exactly* the same way :D

flower_!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
is this comment correct? https://codeberg.org/ziglings/exercises/src/branch/main/exercises/048_methods2.zig#L14

1742474791
flower_!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
shouldn't it be "orelse null"

1742474905
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
no. .? unwraps the optional

1742474958
flower_!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
is that optional always null?

1742474982
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
no, if it’s null .? is runtime checked safety in Safe or debug builds 

1742474994
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
if it’s null you’ll crash

1742475271
flower_!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
but "orelse unreachable" is not correct, right?

1742475297
flower_!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
unreachable if for when a case can't happen isn't?

1742475559
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
yeah, unreachable tells the compiler that branch can’t happen

1742475591
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
if (maybe_foo == null) return;

1742475610
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
const foo = maybe_foot orelse unreachable;

1742475720
flower_!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
ok, I'll try to let that sink in

1742476165
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
orelse unreachable is the same as .?

1742476247
flower_!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
hm ok

1742476334
flower_!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
so in that example it is used to tell the compiler that the method should not be called when the struct *Elephant is null

1742476342
flower_!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
?

1742476375
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
No, it’s saying “I, the programmer, know that this is not null. if I am wrong you may crash the program”

1742476403
flower_!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
I see

1742476453
flower_!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
but does that happen at runtime, or does the compiler catches it?

1742476469
flower_!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
some sort of panic

1742476476
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
Runtime safety checked. Only in ReleaseSafe and Debug

1742478699
flower_!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl

21

1742479281

how large is zen_manyptr?

1742479305
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
is there a zen_manyptr.len?

1742479413
flower_!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
probably not

1742479424
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
so how could zenmany_ptr[0..] be 21 items long? where would 21 come from?

1742479594
flower_!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
hm can't test cause I already cheated

1742479614
flower_!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
so []const u8 = zen_manyptr[0..21];

1742479619
flower_!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
?

1742479621
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
yes

1742479645
flower_!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
ok thx

1742479668
flower_!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
so why do they introduce many-item pointers here

1742479698
flower_!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
it seems to add confusion, e.g. makes things extra complicated

1742479729
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
I have very, very rarely come across a many item ptr

1742479736
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
I suppose if you interface with C a lot you will see them more

1742482378
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
flower_, obviously they're overcomplicated, they are exercises

bw!sid2730@user/betawaffle
does anyone know of a good article on how cache coherency and atomic reads/writes interact on modern cpus?

1742485216
bw!sid2730@user/betawaffle
like for example, if one core is doing atomic writes to a cache line, and another core is doing atomic reads from that same address, is it always going to cause contention, and thus slow down the core doing the writing?

1742486138
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
bw: there's many, but this is my current favorite: https://research.swtch.com/mm (which I recently quoted in an HN thread in defense of Zig's decision to remove @fence for now)

1742486172
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
but it's more about the safety problems than the perf problems

1742486230
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
it does touch on the aspects that are important though, e.g. how x86 flushes cache writes

1742486289
bw!sid2730@user/betawaffle
ty :)

1742486445
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
but the safety problems of course are what lead to the perf problems, there's an interplay.  e.g. unsafe "racy" writes on arm/power are pretty cheap even if they touch the same memory, .seq_cst ones are not because they need barriers to work sanely.

1742504098
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
create/destroy is for allocating any single item of a type

if you want to allocate things on the heap, yes

1742504390
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
what the std.mem for ? 

1742504403
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
isn't that heap as well?

1742504419
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
std.mem.Allocator is the interface for the allocators in std.heap

rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
std.heap is the implementations

i don't really wana talk about it :p here is the struct i am working with https://zigbin.io/995398 i know python manages the `ob_base`, so i need to give `stat` memory on init, and free it later. 

1742504995
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
what do you mean "give `stat` memory"

1742505000
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
it's in the same struct as ob_base

1742505028
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
they must be allocated together

1742505038
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
ya! i am not really sure how python api manages memory 

1742505151
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
it allocates things on its heap

1742505216
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
well ya, i am not sure what it does with the struct field i gave it, like should i have done `stat: *x.statx` now i am saying its a pointer and manage the memory myself?

1742505258
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
that's certainly what you need to do if you wanted to allocate x.statx separately from the python object

1742505316
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
if i don't do that you are saying python manages the memory? (that might be easy for me)

1742505395
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
if you what you saying is true then i need to change `ring: c.io_uring` to `ring: *c.io_uring` since io_uring manages the memory. 

1742505568
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
I'm not sure how you believe structs work if this is confusing

1742505805
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
its not that, i am not sure what python capi is doing.

1742505814
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
it doesn't matter what it's doing

1742505849
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
fields in a struct are allocated together

1742506043
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
python objects can have custom alloc/free, see tp_alloc/tp_new/tp_free/tp_dealloc

how am i suppose to know python does it automatically? we are writing C/zig here, you wouldn't assume they did that also... if it was python code you wouldn't have to worry about it.

TIL @import isn't case sensitive in windows

I switched to unmanaged ArrayLists in a data structure in libvaxis and the amount of memory usage savings is embarrassing

The internal screen struct had a buffer of cells - one for each cell in your terminal. each of those had *three* ArrayLists

so, having migrated to ArrayListUnmanaged, when a ignore the atrocious naming for the public methods, I now agree the unmanaged flavor results in better code... but the more I think about how to make it easier to adopt for people unfamiliar with allocations as having a cost. The more I think zig needs some kind of polymorphism

std.mem.Allocator, std.io.AnyReader, an Auth api I've created, the list of things that behave alike, but lack some feature that makes using them as easy as a normal function is

just tried `.use_llvm = false,` on my code, error, so not there yet :) can't comment on twitch, no login.
