so because std.testing.expectEqual is (expected, actual), it means it can't infer the type of expected, and I AM SO SORRY but I made a struct type that's annoying to name. am I holding it wrong?

can you elaborate on your issue please? I make little sense of what you are saying.

Drixtan: if you're doing expectEqual of a struct, you have to do expectEqual(MyBigFatStruct(T) { ... }, ...). instead of just expectEqual(.{ ... }, ...)

tbh I am over my initial complain, was probably more a mild annoyance that wasn't worth voicing
