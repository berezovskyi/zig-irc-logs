default parameters is a form of polymorphism and it is also less flexible than using a struct because function arguments must be ordered

I mean your complaint is effectively just a problem with the tooling being immature. The actual null hypothesis would be why add a new language feature when an existing language feature (structs with default fields) covers the use case

so really you would need to argue for default parameters
