Hey Loris (don't know your handle (kristoff_it?), the post on ziglang.org's first outage may be more than a month old by now, but there might be a capital error with attributing the problem in it: How have you determined it was Facebooks' bots and not somebody elses posing under a Facebook UA?

1761387393
Travelan!~travelan@user/travelan
StopNGo I suspect the server operator has checked and banned the IP's, and I assume the IP ranges are owned by Facebook. I think they removed/hided the specific IP addresses from the blog post and logs, for privacy reasons (as there were also legitimate requests seeping through).

1761387411

1761387597

Basically bots are using the Facebook Share Debugger to DDOS sites... So it's not Facebook themselves, they just operate an open proxy... They're not too smart overthere I guess :-)

projects that can't tell that LLM generated code is a mistake is a ***huge*** red flag about code quality and alignment with values about code quality that I care about, so seeing a project expending effort to support or enable their use demonstrates the project can't make reasonable judgements about code quality, is just demonstarting that it would be a mistake to put my trust in the repo

1761415711
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
as a counter example for projects that demonstate a good faith effort, ziglang/zig. See their stance on the use of LLMs for not only code, but for "lower effort" portions like issues as well

I 100% agree with you on that LLM generated code (and vibe coding in general) is a huge red flag. That doesn't invalidate the value that a tool like ChatGPT could have for new and experienced programmers. You just shouldn't let it do _your_ work for you.

you have been mislead. Attention based transformers demonstrate **no** evidence to suggest they can reason, or use logic. They make trivial logic mistakes based on their training set.

ppl are naturally lazy, if something can write the code for them, later they can make $ off of it, of course ppl are going to use it

1761416758
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
attention based transformers, generate the next most likely token, based on all previous tokens. They predict the most likely word, if they're trained on common, or popular examples where logic happens to be correct, they will emit a reasonable token. But that's not logic. 

1761416773
erock!8a023a9e4a@pico/erock
grayhatter: 

1761416818
erock!8a023a9e4a@pico/erock
when trained on code that expresses logic, their attention heads have "learned" logic, and it is obvious when you start using them that they can "understand" it

1761416908
erock!8a023a9e4a@pico/erock
we can argue that they don't understand anything or that what they are doing isn't actually logic, but when you can ask it to write a novel code block, it will write it and be able to run it without issues

1761416929
erock!8a023a9e4a@pico/erock
and if there are issues, you can ask it to fix it and it'll figure it out

1761416943

1761417104
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
grayhatter, what are you wanting? logic is the lowest form of thinking/solving. 

1761417105
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
happy to defer, or table the discussion. :) But quality, and desire to provide attention, and proveably correct code matters to me. The ethics, effort, and values that form the basis for said work also matters to me

1761417158
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
sounds like you want to write this code yourself.

1761417166
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
stealth_: an example of logic, as reasonably defined, could be: 1 + 1 = 2 

1761417201
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I'd argue, the logic that goes into writing code you can believe is correct, is *much* more complicated than just that

1761417201
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
grayhatter, you are assuming whoever is reading it knows math. 

1761417250
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
stealth_: no, I'm talking about reasoning. The ability to infer something novel, instead of copy pasting random blocks of code statements until it looks like something that may work

1761417255
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
just like that you are assuming ai knows what you are even thinking/wanting the end result to be.

1761417298

1761417433
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
its just a glorified search engine, assuming anything more then that you will end up hurt.

1761417454
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
it's not even that

1761417463
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
AI can't do search without an external backend

1761417477
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
it's a randomized text to text translator

1761417516
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
ai reminds me of stock photos! at first you search for house and it finds you bunch of houses, later it runs out of houses to show and you have looked at everything and its a let down after that point.

1761417523
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
but you're kinda close; if you think it can do anything other than translate some text into different text, with a bunch of random noise added in to make it interesting, you'll end up hurt

1761417577
davros1!~davros2@2a01:4b00:f01b:3e00:b818:4dda:b3e8:40e7
AI is definitely better than just having docs 

1761417586
Travelan!~travelan@user/travelan
strictly spoken, an LLM isn't even a translator. It's a statistical machine that, given an input, predicts the next word that is most likely to follow the input. And then does that word for word until some statistic indicates that the output is finished.

1761417616
davros1!~davros2@2a01:4b00:f01b:3e00:b818:4dda:b3e8:40e7
You can ask a plain English question expressing intent and get useful advice on which library functions to use

1761417667
ha0tix!~ha0tix@user/ha0tiX
It's good for searching docs, right + sometimes when you need to example of something to refreshing your memory

1761417671
davros1!~davros2@2a01:4b00:f01b:3e00:b818:4dda:b3e8:40e7
To predict the next word it has to understand the rules that generate words (if you dont beleive in a supernatural soul, a human is also a machine) .. it's just got vastly fewer parameters than our brains and probably iterates less

1761417722
davros1!~davros2@2a01:4b00:f01b:3e00:b818:4dda:b3e8:40e7
If you compare synapses to weights.. 100trillion synapses in our brains I think.. vs the biggest AI models are around 1trillino paramters (connections) 

1761417729
davros1!~davros2@2a01:4b00:f01b:3e00:b818:4dda:b3e8:40e7
Plus we train for many years

1761417774
davros1!~davros2@2a01:4b00:f01b:3e00:b818:4dda:b3e8:40e7
Hinton's comment is that given what it's doing with the relative parameter count, it's possible it's already got a more efficient training process (but I think it's more that its a shortcut to use text directly)

I suspect you don't

1761417838
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
(This approach to ai was rejected in the 60s because they were not convinced you could prove the reasoning and so the data it returned would never be trustable. This is a bit more important for miltary fof work back then)

1761417875
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
this is an example of why I trust the output of humans more than I trust LLMs (and I don't really trust most humans)

1761417900
davros1!~davros2@2a01:4b00:f01b:3e00:b818:4dda:b3e8:40e7
I think AI is mostly about scale, the brain is 100t params, we can't expect huiman-level intelligence until we get computers that can deal with 100trilion weights, but we might get a net effect that is remarkable because of economies of scale online 

1761417918
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
grayhatter: Here's the deal though; people make mistakes. The only goal here is for ai to make as many mistakes or fewer to be better

1761417927
davros1!~davros2@2a01:4b00:f01b:3e00:b818:4dda:b3e8:40e7
LLMs have got so far because they are trained on internet text, and can in turn be shared on the internet

1761417938
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
Which is a bit utilitarian, but that's what it is

1761417954
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
davros1: I think comparing it to human neurons is reasonable... but then I'd encourage you to consider why everyone calls it a LLM, and then consider the size and specificity of the language centers of the human brain

1761417968
davros1!~davros2@2a01:4b00:f01b:3e00:b818:4dda:b3e8:40e7
Important point is to count synapses, not neurons

1761417969
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
Earnestly: no, absoltulely not

1761418008
davros1!~davros2@2a01:4b00:f01b:3e00:b818:4dda:b3e8:40e7
Synapses and weights. One 'digital neurone' is definitely not equivalent to one biological neuron. But the whole connectomne is probably more the thign to consider r.e. information scale 

1761418053
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
that's a really common example that's been stolen from the field of self driving cars

1761418063
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter

I've been neglecting that feature because I've currently been distracted by Verse (the type checked zig web framework that it's built on top of)

I started self-hosting forgejo for fun and the response times ruined GitHub for me. I had been a nice little froggy in my boiling pot of water.

i got a bug reproduction case for x86-linux using the (a?) wrong calling convention for cdecl

1761430380
lemons!~doggie@user/doggie-:49517
where do i submit it

1761430456

lemons!~doggie@user/doggie-:49517
ignore my dumbness for a moment then, ech

1761431105
lemons!~doggie@user/doggie-:49517
argument order broke in one of my projects after switching from x86-windows to x86-linux

1761431131
lemons!~doggie@user/doggie-:49517
trying to make a repro for it now since the calling convention on the host seems to be the same

1761432752
lemons!~doggie@user/doggie-:49517
its not exactly 1-1 since it doesnt load it at all instead of arbitrarily flipping arguments

1761432762
lemons!~doggie@user/doggie-:49517
and non-zero chance im still being dumb here

1761432829
lemons!~doggie@user/doggie-:49517
but compiling with    zig build-lib -dynamic main.zig -Dtarget=x86-native    throws    Error loading library: ./supplement.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64

1761432929
lemons!~doggie@user/doggie-:49517
(so does x86-linux for the record)

1761434119
lemons!~doggie@user/doggie-:49517
ech.. nevermind, its -target x86-linux not -Dtarget=x86-linux

1761434124
lemons!~doggie@user/doggie-:49517
fixing that makes it work
