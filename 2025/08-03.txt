what is the use-case for explicitly tagged unions?

Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
for example, I had to call different code based on the tag of an union, which the user was defining at runtime. I had a switch on that union, which gave me the correct branch and the user's data.

is this the right way to be passing around stdin/stdout as generic reader/writer in 0.15? accessing .interface on the File.Writer? var stdout = std.fs.File.stdout().writer(buf[64..]).interface;

that's how I would do it
