andrewrk: I saw that you got quite the backlash for suggesting that people at Microsoft should be criticized for working for them. I think it was a refreshing take and I personally feel that's the energy we should have towards all of FAANG and more.

gonz_: I appreciate the words of support, although I don't feel that is an accurate summary of my statement or beliefs

how can I get a comptime function to return an enum at comptime?

what problem do you run into

I haven't ran into a problem yet. I'm just wondering there is something more that I have to do than a `return EnumFoo.bar;`

are we building the enum at comptime or just returning a value from an existing one? If the latter, nothing different.
