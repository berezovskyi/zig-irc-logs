I could see this being useful as a comptime parameter like `fn f(comptime x: [_]Stuff) void`

hm, why not a normal slice?

`try writeTokens(writer, .{ .magic, .directory });` looks nicer than `try writeTokens(writer, &.{ .magic, .directory });`

idk it's just one char

also in that case you can do anytype

same as what's done for e.g. formatting

It's a non-pub function, so it's probably okay.

I finished watching your Roadmap 2026 Andrew; very nice and interesting new things, especially the IO as an interface idea. This is something I’ve been wanting in many other languages for a long time, for many reasons (non-color functions; effects isolation; testing à-là-sans-io; etc.) I’m not sure to understand the status quo regarding devirtualization just yet, especially when a function will

be executed via a function pointers loaded at runtime taking an Io (you can’t devirtualize that, correct?), but overall I think I’ll be playing with it soon :)

you'd think Zig is an existential threat to some people based on the way people react to in any thread discussing it

I suppose for that kind of person, it is, and it explains everything about their attitude

rvrb: I don't blame them. many people generally don't have control over what technologies they get to use in their careers, so they're basically rooting for their favorite team to win

andrewrk: that’s a helpfully generous perspective. if I do engage, like I did, I try to give them room to self reflect and try again. so far no one has taken me up on the offer
