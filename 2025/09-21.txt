Is there something I need to do different to debug with 0.15.1? Worked great in 0.14.1 but now I'm seeing "Unable to determine byte size" for every variable. 

1758419587
deevus!~deevus@7wdf1tt0vhfbrrrfm74p.ip6.superloop.au
Ohh is this because it's not using LLVM. Duh

deevus!~deevus@7wdf1tt0vhfbrrrfm74p.ip6.superloop.au
At this point it seems like I have to use LLVM anyway. I keep getting segfaults when using the self-hosted from inside Godot. But it will be useful for other projects.

1758420212
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
sounds potentially linker related

1758420290
deevus!~deevus@7wdf1tt0vhfbrrrfm74p.ip6.superloop.au
I can dig into it further if you think it would be useful. However this might be a niche use-case since Godot is the running program calling into the Zig lib as an extension

1758420351
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
I'd suggest continuing with the LLVM backend workaround until the new linker (https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/25299) surpasses LLD

what deevus said

ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
hm, I think I tried removing it

1758423074
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
are you talking about "linkSystemLibrary("c")"? b/c that's what I try to take out

1758423139
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
it seems that b/c of std.c.if_nametoindex I need to keep it linked

1758423227
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
ezzieyguywuf: sounds like you'll have to implement if_nametoindex in zig then :P

1758423249
deevus!~deevus@7wdf1tt0vhfbrrrfm74p.ip6.superloop.au
It's because you're using `std.c.AF.PACKET` and perhaps other definitions from `std.c`

1758423367
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
std.os.linux.AF.PACKET exists

ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
heh

1758424522
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
so I should use std.os.linux.blah instead? what about if_nametoindex tho?

1758424688
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
do you want a link to zig code where I've implemented something kinda similar to if_nametoindex or a link to the c source code for it?

1758424740
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I haven't implemented if_nametoindex, because I didn't need it, and didn't want it, but I do have something that can read that infomation

1758424766
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
the c source was half easy to read, assuming you already know a bit of C

1758424807

andrew, your specific pattern of "brilliant jerk" (the definition of jerk must have changed recently?) is a big part of why I love writing code again (zig specifically) and it's why I'm happy to keep donating to zsf... sorry the internet is being stupid in your general direction

I’m not sure what to call it, but I definitely understand how it can come off as apathetic when you’re running OSS such as zig. For years I’ve been the admin of the ScoopInstaller org. I have found it difficult to conduct myself in a way that is not only effective but doesn’t give the wrong impression to the community.

clevor!sid649024@id-649024.hampstead.irccloud.com
I know a core developer of a FOSS project I am interested in who is condescending, unfortunately. I haven't forgiven him for the worst thing he told me yet. :/

1758426754
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I don't think it's just an OSS problem, the US is very angry, and people (humans), are, predictably, lashing out at each other

Is it due to politics?

1758426834
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
the increased temprature is causing people to interpret things incorrectly, and then because of the attached impatience, forget to assume good faith

1758426851

clevor: I think politics are a symptom more than a cause

What do you mean by temperature?

1758426930
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I don't mean to imply it's an all or nothing thing, if you start shouting at someone because you have a headache, and you have a headache because you're sick and dehydrated. You'd correctly apologize for being mean because of your headache, ever though there are additional causes 

1758426972
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
temperature being a euphemism for "generalized upset or anger"

1758426980
clevor!sid649024@id-649024.hampstead.irccloud.com
Okay

1758427037
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
e.g. the common phrase would be something like, if you'd put a bunch of people in a room, someone starts being angry, and then everyone else starts being angry back, they "raised the temerature of the room"

1758427123
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I assume because many people feel physically hotter when they get angry? but I never bothered to verify the etymology

I tend to see people's actions towards me as more critical than they are, making me feel ashamed of making the perceived mistake. I felt that at first when andrewrk reviewed one of my PRs, so I had to think carefully about what he said in order to dispel that cognitive distortion.

historically, I've been very good at ignoring said feelings, and hyper focusing on the specifics/details of the interaction

1758427765
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
recently I've started to adopt the intent to understand the root cause of said feelings

1758427852
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
while I'm very familiar with feeling ashamed except for exceptionally egregious mistakes that caused actual harm to someone else, I can't imagine feeling shame over a PR/review comment

1758427934

1758428100
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
but put another way, if you're sure it wasn't ark's intent to make you feel bad, (I'm sure it wasn't), might be worth trying to figure out what you saw that reminded you to feel bad... you can't fix bugs in a miscalculated perception when you're ignoring them :)
