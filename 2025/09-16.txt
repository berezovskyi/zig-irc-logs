Is there a way to do skip only specific tests with `zig build`? `-Dtest-filter` seems to just be a substring test

daurnimator, dumb way that would work: use `addOptions` and then do something like `if (your_options.skip_certain_tests) return error.SkipZigTest;` in the tests you want to skip

squeek502: I'm trying to do this when running the zig compiler's tests.

ah, then not sure, note that `-Dtest-filter` can be specified multiple times if that helps at all (if the fully qualified name of the test matches any filter, then that test is skipped)

(sorry, i meant *not* skipped)

Has anyone here tried to read a PDF into a zig program?  I want to scrape text out of one that is just text in some tables, and unfortunately the software they're being produced by doesn't have any other output formats

tsmanner: I don't know of a PDF parser for Zig.  What little I recall about PDF in general is that writing a "parser" for it is pretty non-trivial.  It's a container that can contain a whole lot of varied and complex things...

Yeah, I came across a lib or two, mostly in C, and there's a _lot_ in there.  I was hoping to find a native zig implementation somewhere

but you could probably do something hacky by looking at the bytes of the generated PDFs and finding some marker that lets you parse those particular files in a hacky way

Odds are I'll port this C lib's make files to my build.zig and fetch the sources

what about piping then to something like pdf2txt or so?

is `file.close()` with unflushed data ever valid?

grayhatter: no

Unless you don't need/want the remaining data to be written
