I am working on narser again, and I have to map each kind of file (https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.fs.Dir.Entry.Kind) to either a symlink, directory, or file. Should the rest just be considered files?

What is the working directory of a Zig test?

iirc the test root is somewhere in .zig-cache, and there was an issue somewhere mentioning that it's not affected by ZIG_LOCAL_CACHE_DIR envvar

clevor: the working directory of a zig test is unspecified... but asking that question probably means you're doing something wrong

I am opening a directory to see if my parser will correctly encode a directory.

find the file in build.zig, and provide it's absolute directory via options

clevor: the build system is very good, there's proabbly a better but undocumented way than I know of

I added a TODO comment for now as I am troubleshooting the entry sorting.
