insults... like *all* comments... should say more about the target than they should about the speaker

1749360690

ahh, I figured out what the other thing that bothered me about the phrase... the worst part about rust is there's huge sections of it's community that are super toxic, people willing to lie or be divisive at the expense of others just so they can feel better about the language they picked... I *really* like that I haven't seen that yet (guess I have to start saying 'rare' tonight) coming from the zig

1749360692
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
community. I see many rustations take cheap shots, it's a point of pride that I don't see zig people do it. I'm disappointed by the phrase, because I'd really rather not have to start apologizing for toxic things the zig community does... I like that we're still better

1749364629

how can i efficiently combine arbitrary things to hash them?  i want to create hash map with keys like: `struct { ?[]const u8, u16 }` .. so i'm trying to use std.HashMap but i don't know how to implement `Context.hash()`

1749375139
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
i mean one way I could make it work would be fmt everything into one "big" string and hash that using std.hash_map.hashString but that feels inefficient 

1749376398
Atque!Atque@user/Atque
netvor: Just serialise them to one string, say a custom binary format, json, bson or whatever. Then just hash the combined string.

1749376934
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
yeah i just felt that would be inefficient, but i have little experience in low level so maybe my hunch was wrong

1749377425
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
You could hash the string, then hash the u16 as a byte slice

1749377588
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
You might be able to xor (reasonably strong) hashes together, too. Wouldn't do that with basic complement "checksums" though; probably too correlated

1749377908
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
i'm going with simple .print custom serialization for now, thanks

grayhatter: Nowadays, I jokingly tell people to Rewrite it in Rust, and I have yet to see anyone take offense to it. I used to be more into Rust, but I had issue with its lack of arbitrary-width integers (u24 specifically because eZ80) and large binary sizes when using the standard library.

how do I actually start a executable from zig without wait? Like when you would use a '&' in the shell

1749402110

fork?

1749402164

hm nah probably not

1749403821
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
flower__: & and, [not waiting] are two very different things

1749403864
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
describe the problem you're looking at, or the objective you want, without naming a method (the wait in "without wait" is a method)

1749403931
flower__!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
I want to launch a executable (on linux), which needs to run in it's own process, e.g. if my zig app stops, it should still run. Launching the executable shouldn't block my zig application.

1749403963
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
LAC-Tech: couldn't agree more, with both points... but by the same token, any well adjusted adult wouldn't take cheap shots at another person... so...

1749404034
flower__!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
Launch is from my zig application / code. There is std.process.Child.run, but it's blocking and the executable runs in the same process I think

1749404077
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
that's not how a child process works at all, wait() is literally "wait" where the parent process stops until the child process exits

1749404112
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
you don't have to wait, and then both will run however the OS kernel decides they should run

1749404199
flower__!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
On success must call kill or wait. After spawning the id is available.

1749404240
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I disagree with that comment

1749404258
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
your program is bad if it doesn't wait for it's children... but it doesn't *have* to wait or kill them

1749404282
flower__!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
I think the childprocess dies when the zig application dies 

1749404307
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
it shouldn't... but there are reasons it might

1749404358
flower__!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
but there must be other ways, like the shell is able to run a process in the background with a ampersand

1749404360
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
IIRC process.child.spawn is fork, and execv 

1749404394
flower__!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
there is a fork() in std.posix

1749404401
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
so fork duplicates the current proccess exactly, creating two, and execv "exits" the current binary and "enters" the target binary

1749404493
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
generally, you have the parent which calls fork, and the child which calls execv to "change" into the target binary... both will be running concurrently. and the parent process can wait() (block until the child process exits) or, it might not call wait, and then the child process will be running in the background

1749404533
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
this is true for linux/posix like systems, I think windows has a few extra details that I don't remember but they're rarely important

1749404570
flower__!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
hm ok, that's why fork() doesn't need arguments ... hm

1749404572
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
the shell `&` symbol is just a shell "hack" that tells your shell, not to call wait()

1749404601
flower__!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
ok let me spawn without wait first

1749405125
flower__!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
ok spawn and not wait works, but indeed the child dies with the parent

1749405690
flower__!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
maybe this is good enough for now

1749406043
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
flower__: well maybe you could hack it with `sh -c 'prog &'` as here   https://bpa.st/EGJA   provided the other program's name is hardcoded and/or you can take care of quoting

1749406137
cancername_!~cancernam@user/cancername
flower__: you want to run a process that doesn't die when its parent dies, correct?

1749406203
cancername_!~cancernam@user/cancername
try the double-fork technique: fork once to get a child process, fork another time from the child to get rid of the controlling terminal, then exec

1749406287
flower__!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
netvor: ah I tried that, probably not quoted right then

1749406288
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
i think that's what the sh hack basically does, in a rough way (and non-portable)

1749406465
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
or do it the correct way and create a new process group after fork but before exec

1749406511
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
whatever you do, do not do it the way netvor suggested... that's how you create critical security defects

1749406584
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
i think it can be done safely depending on the context, but yeah there are footguns

1749406596
cancername_!~cancernam@user/cancername
grayhatter: not necessarily but yes, true, that is how you make command injections

1749406631
cancername_!~cancernam@user/cancername
flower__: try forking, then in the fork, using the std.process.Child API, that should work

1749406649
cancername_!~cancernam@user/cancername
in the child *

1749406744
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
it can be done safely

1749406751
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I've never once seen it done safely

1749406759
cancername_!~cancernam@user/cancername
unfortunately!

1749406779
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
and the people who I believe could do it safely, would never try because they understand how fragile it is

1749406801
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
so, effectively, it can't be done safely, because it's only done by people who can't do it safely

1749406822
cancername_!~cancernam@user/cancername
it's a classic router firmware mistake

1749406823

1749406905

1749406929

yeah i also have an invisible dragon in my garage who can drive drunk and double-fork via sh safely :D

1749406947

netvor: I'm describing something I've learned to be true after years of working in information security

1749406963
cancername_!~cancernam@user/cancername
flower__: either fork/fork/exec or fork/Child.spawn will do the same thing

1749407027

cancername_: ok thx

1749407075

1749407154

"LookPath searches for an executable named file in the directories named by the PATH environment variable."

1749407163

flower__: are you sure you're asking the question correctly?

1749407192
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter

llm is not usually that high on horse tbh :D

1749407296
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
flower__: the concept you're missing is path expansion

1749407323
cancername_!~cancernam@user/cancername
flower__: it will expand a simple name in argv[0], like "echo", to a path, like "/usr/bin/echo"

1749407390
flower__!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
but can it be used to check if a binary is in PATH?

1749407418
flower__!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
command -v 

1749407425
flower__!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
which

1749407436
cancername_!~cancernam@user/cancername
flower__: no, but arguably that's not that useful either -- if it can't be found, spawn will fail

1749407471
flower__!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
cancername_: and does it tell that it fails cause it's not in PATH?

1749407566
flower__!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
FileNotFound probably, hm

1749407573
cancername_!~cancernam@user/cancername
flower__: it will return error.FileNotFound in that case, that logic is in https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.posix.execvpeZ_expandArg0

1749407640
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
the correct way, would be checking path for the binary yourself... but also, what cancername_ said

1749407722
flower__!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
ok I wrote down notes about your exec / fork comments, like a good LLM should.

1749408132

sorry grayhatter but i'm with cancername_ on this one.  you were on your high horse again today

1749408182
cancername_!~cancernam@user/cancername
grayhatter: I did, to point out that you could maybe Not Do That

1749408226
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
generally, if someone is being grumpy (high on their horse) compassion, and asking "hey, you ok, that was rude" has a much better outcome than accusing them of being arrogant

1749408241
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
especially if you're gonna be annoyed if they respond poorly to that

1749408274
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
but I think you're right

1749408290
cancername_!~cancernam@user/cancername
grayhatter: yeah could have been phrased better

1749408291
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
sorry for being grumpy at you flower__; I shouldn't have been rude

1749408316
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
i;d say that if someone is calling out your arrogance, responding by mentoring them on the topic of arrogance is not the green flag

1749408321
flower__!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
grayhatter: no worries, I knew who said it

grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
<3

1749408479
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
netvor: I still stand behind my original assertion. It's not arrogance if you're right

1749408516
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
the devil is in the details  (and sometimes in the eye of the observer :D)

1749408540
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
for something to be exaggerated, it has to be "above" the reality of the thing

1749408577
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
if it's accurate, it by definition, can not be "above" or exaggerated... then the rest of the connatation of arrogant is the tone of the messsage

1749408626
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
and if you don't apprecate the tone used about something that's correct, it's better to say they're impatent (or a bad communicator)

grayhatter: you can certainly be correct while overemphasizing your own importance and knowledge or deemphasizing others'

1749408666

"grahatter posted x truths today"

1749408687
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
just read your messages

1749408718
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
cancername_: which comment did you feel overemphisized my own importance?

1749408739
flower__!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
WTF who made that up, truth social. Newspeak. Anyway...

1749408745
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
tbh i would find at least 2 that would fit the bill

1749408774
cancername_!~cancernam@user/cancername
mainly <grayhatter> do you know what lookpath does? or are you just blindly copying some magic you saw before like an LLM?

1749408798
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
netvor: I genuinely don't see them? I agree the LLM comment was rude, but it's not arrogent

1749408832
cancername_!~cancernam@user/cancername
it emphasizes your own capabilities while deemphasizing others', works for me

1749408842
cancername_!~cancernam@user/cancername
I don't care enough to keep going

Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
flower__: it's tradition that everything with "truth" in the name is actually the opposite

1749408888
flower__!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
Gliptic: makes sense now

1749409026
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
eg. "few extra details that I don't remember but they're rarely important"  .. "describe the problem you're looking at, or the objective you want, without naming a method" .. " I'm describing something I've learned to be true after years of working in information security" ... then that thing about clowntown, which i suppose was a jab at my spelling (but i don't know since en is not my 1st language) 

1749409067
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
i just got the vibe that we're talking to someone who listens more to their own voice than to this chat

1749409076
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
cancername_: I disagree that it does either. It was rude to compare a poorly asked question to "guessing" like an LLM, and I regret not taking the time to add the context to my comment to include the kindness that flower__ deservered. (really, sorry again flower__ :/ ) but I stand by the idea that the mistake in the question was not trying to figure out how lookpath does, to ask what's the correct way

1749409078
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
to do "thing" 

1749409088
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
but then again, i might be wrong and just too grumpy today

1749409140
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
netvor: clowny and clowntown is a commen meme for code that looks like it was written by a clown

1749409146
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
basically this meme https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/putting-on-clown-makeup

1749409206
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
so you're trying to convince me that you're not actually arrogant, you're just calling me clown, right?  makes a lot of sense :D /s

1749409340
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
the rest was trying to describe the experiance I've had, I was intentionally terse, because I didn't feel it was important. My expectation was you could trust that I was trying to help, describing mistakes that I see all the time that you could avoid. Without trying to explain the whole contextual reasoning that I had because there's a lot of important but tiny details... none of which actually help

1749409342
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
solve the problem he asked about, so would be likely to waste time

1749409381
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
don't get me wrong, I do trust that you want to help .. and also that you know a lot

1749409390
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
netvor, don't take personally what grayhatter is saying. I think he's often high on something else than horses, but he has a good heart, just a little bit awkward socially. He seems to have a ton of knowledge. Enjoy the good part, forget about the rest perhaps...

1749409394
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
i've been here fo long enough

1749409464
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
netvor: I mean if you're actually suggesting double fork using sh -c as what someone "should do" then yes, that's clowny

1749409508
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
yep, and that's exactly what i was not suggesting.  I deliberately described it as a hack and also qualified it

1749409579
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
"just a little bit awkward socially" <- um, actually! I'm not at all socially awkward; I'm just an asshole who's bad at communicating... big difference :P

1749409593
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
LOL

1749409624
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
don't worry i'm also an asshole, i'm just too shy to be arrogant, um, i mean, high  ... or whatever :D

1749409673
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
netvor: I knew you weren't seriously suggesting it... which is why I called the suggestion clowntown, instead of calling you a clown. But I didn't trust that everyone else would know it was a mistake... and I didn't want anyone to just copy it without thinking (another security issue I see ALL*THE*TIME)

1749409674
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
actually some of my best friends sometimes sound like grayhatter  :D

1749409808
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
well... this was a fun roast... I regret trying to help... sorry for being grumpy

1749409823
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
one could say that the copy without thinking is the ONLY security issue that's really important

1749409843
lolok!~lolok@user/lolok
you only get points if you explain *why* the hack fails

1749409911
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
and minus points if you suggest that we should trust you because you learned it ... blah blah (coz we're all n000bs you know) :D

1749410614
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
<grayhatter> or do it the correct way and create a new process group after fork but before exec

1749410642
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I did explain why the hack works, and the correct way to do it

1749410836
lolok!~lolok@user/lolok
that it works is not in question, why is it a mistake? for what reason would only a clown do it?

1749410965
lolok!~lolok@user/lolok
aw, he just left... i really wanted to know...

1749411598
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
it's sad, all this knowledge gone. I feel despair in the room now :s - Back to LLM I guess *shrug*

1749411624
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
my company is pushing for LLM usage, like the CTO said: "whatever what it throws at you, if it works, whatever the stack, use it."

1749411640
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
LLM is totally going to suggest me zig stuff

1749411870
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
lolok: there are lot of issues with using `sh -c` ...  sh -c invokes full-blown shell language, which has a ton of implied details (envvars, quoting, current dir..) . 

1749411935
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
i hope that is a fake quote from your cto

1749411941
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
if not, i recommend looking for a different job

1749411951
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
i am guilty of using it, though... eg. i let user specify a script in an ini file and then i run it from zig using `sh -c`, which is not super safe, and would be horribly unsafe if the output came from untrusted source 

1749412044
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
but eg. running a well-known binary, without args, from a well controlled system (eg. inside a container) using full path, without arguments .. has less risk

1749412116
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
that said, sh -c is a subpar method of double forking, if someone can do it right using std and/or syscalls then that's far better, if *only* because sh is too complex for a tool

1749412160
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
*too complex tool for the job

1749412272
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
btw grayhatter wrote own shell in zig so i'm sure they do know more about forking https://github.com/GrayHatter/hsh 

1749412835
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
torque, yea, that's real. But no worries, cto is only talking, everybody in the company went like: "hmm hmm, whatever", so that's that. At least, everybody else is on the same page here.

1749412904
lolok!~lolok@user/lolok
ok the part about invoking a whole shell just to fork makes sense, but idk about the security... if the problem is that the user points a gun at their feet, and gives you a malicious binary to run, how does it change what happens if that fork happens in a shell or a syscall?

1749413122
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
it doesn't imho.  i think if there's a good argument to be made it's more along the "slippery slope" .. which is not always a fallacy 

1749413273
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
i mean, more complex machine means more surface for bugs and exploits, to me that's good enough to be careful.  but the common examples with path etc.  i'm not so sure they really apply in many cases 

1749413384
lolok!~lolok@user/lolok
lol its always a fallacy, its just that an improper argument doesnt necessarily imply an invalid conclusion; thats called the fallacy fallacy

1749416725
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
what's your license for your open-source projects guys? MIT? GPL? I am in a struggle right now. I am about to release something to the wurlldd and well, I am not used to do that in an "official way".

1749416803
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
i usually go for gpl2 or lgpl2 but no one ever uses my code so i haven't been forced to face any consequences of that :D

1749416810
flower__!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
UEPL and MPL are interesting as well

1749416857
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
some people dislike GPL and consider eg. MIT more "free"

1749416864
flower__!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
depends on what you want. Do others need to share their code as well? All the code or only edits to your code? 

1749416972
flower__!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
AGPL3, GPL3, GPL2, LGPL3, LGPL2, EUPL, MPL, MIT >>>

1749417043
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
not that I am anti-corporation, but... MIT seems a bit too "free", GPL and its other flavours seem a little bit too "scary" for small enterprise that could use the code... something something in the middle

1749417060
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
I will check those eupl mpl, I don't know them, thx

1749417077
flower__!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
LGPL, EUPL or MPL 

1749417092
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
i thought lgpl is "in the middle" but i haven't really done the research properly

1749417138
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
last time i checked (long ago) gpl3 was the one considered going too far 

1749417164
flower__!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
LGPL has restriction on static linking (it is allowed but ...), while EUPL and MPL allow static linking more liberal 

1749417311
netvor!~netvor@85.163.148.92
wow i did not even know "European Union Public Licence" even existed :D  kinda funny .. but why not :D  (i can already hear the squeaking of the anti-EU folks :D)

1749417339

1749417431
flower__!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
downside to me is that's it's compatible with quite some other licenses. In that sense GPL is more straightforward. 

1749417529
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
yea, I've just learnt about EUPL, it makes sense when you have 22 countries, speaking different languages, in a union, making free software. With the "new administration", we are seeing the EU getting "more" serious about their software sovereignty - so why not

1749417559
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
MPL seems attractive thou, thx guys 

1749417567
flower__!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
EUPL is not for EU only, it can be used around the world and that's done

Now, when you target x86_64, by default, Zig will use its own x86 backend rather than using LLVM  ?? what, already? I thought it was something "for later" -- that's amazing
