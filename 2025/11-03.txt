people who write [langage I don't like] solve the problem by importing a new dependency, people who write in [zig] solve the problem by writing more code

You can get into the same dependency hell in Zig if you really wanted to.

doesnt the dependency import level of a language simply correlate on whether its standard library is batteries included or not?

daurnimator!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
rockorager: I've seen too many half baked arg libraries to trust roll-your-own for anything but the simplest CLI

1762165737
daurnimator!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
a good args library makes error messages, help and usage consistent (but not the same, e.g. prints to stderr vs stdout; or e.g. shorter help output on error); it can do things like give you completions; and they *should* help with typing

1762189249
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
re: the debates about arg-parsing libs: it definitely is easy-enough to just iterate the args array and do your own thing, and I also suspect we'll have several more-automagic modules over time in the Zig community (to auto-generate from docs + types in some struct, etc), and all that's fine for greenfield stuff.

1762189319
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
but, regardless of how you want the code interface to look (and there could be a few options there too), it'd be nice to have a module or two that comply with POSIX and/or CLI-parsing standards, just because it makes seamless porting of old C software less-breaky for the end users.

1762189395
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
and by "standards", I mean the way they handle all the odd cases like "-abc N" vs "-a -b -c N", the --/- equivalencies, etc....  people will have old C software that used getopt(), and the Zig replacement will want to support parsing all the forms that were legal in the old version, so people don't have to go update scripts everywhere for new CLI syntax.

1762189524
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
one of the many tricky legacy aspects of that, is that if you have defined 3 single-letter options "a", "b", and "c", and only "c" takes an argument (as shown above), the user can also write "-abcfoo" as equivalent to "-a -b -c foo"

1762189565
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
none of that is nice, but if you ever want all the basic old *nix CLI utilities ported to Zig (I do!), we'll need a module that supports those legacy parsing styles exactly.

1762189598
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
why would you ever want to support such insanity in newly written software?

1762189608
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
Oh

1762189617
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
grr, I meant to say "POSIX and/or GNU parsing standards" somewhere up there, not "CLI" :)

1762189619
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
I didn't read far enough

1762189645
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
-abcfoo where foo is an arg, not more flags is insane

1762189651
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
yeah :)

1762189695
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
but someone will eventually port all the little binaries like "sort" "uniq" etc...  and someone somewhere will have an old shellscript that uses the flags in that style and breaks

1762189766

I already wrote one, but mine also replicated the braindead interface of basic getopt itself too, so it's not going to see wide reuse.

1762189792
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
it just made C porting simpler because it's nearly 1:1

mortmann!~mortmann@p57b29a94.dip0.t-ipconnect.de
isnt the zig bundled musl libc eventually to be replaced with zig code? then we would get a zig getopt for free.

1762189985
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
is there a way to sort errors by file?

1762190119
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
mortmann: good question.  I thought all libc-like things in the zig tree were just for OS ABI interfaces though.  are they planning to keep imples of the non-interface bits of libc as well?  there are many such bits, e.g. libc's sort(), fnmatch(), etc.

1762190187

basically by non-interface bits, I mean standard libc interfaces to what are basically just algorithms of some kind.
