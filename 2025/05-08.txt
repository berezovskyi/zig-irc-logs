I read in an issue that allocators can't be passed across ZCUs: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/23367#issuecomment-2754915995 . That's a pretty big problem for just about any program that wants to be runtime-extensible. Right, now, the only thing that can be done is to wrap the allocator in an ABI-safe wrapper. Wouldn't it be better to make `std.mem.Allocator` ABI-safe, since it's extremely

widely used? As far as I can tell, that wouldn't incur any drawbacks.

I'm also mildly confused as to why non-native integer sizes aren't ABI-safe, when clang's _BitInt is?
