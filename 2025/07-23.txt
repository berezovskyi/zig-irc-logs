andrewrk: would you be open to some kind of "appendNoResize" that throws an error, to subsume bounded arrays functionality?

Why not have the existing functions take `?Allocator` instead of `Allocator`?

1753229505
LAC-Tech!~lewis@granite-phrase.bnr.la
(there's probably a doc on std lib proposals I should read..)

1753229535
LAC-Tech!~lewis@granite-phrase.bnr.la
clevor: well there's already appendAssumeCapacity, right? so "no allocator" can mean two behaviours

1753229572
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
LAC-Tech: I would, but I'll probably be picky about the naming

1753229634
LAC-Tech!~lewis@granite-phrase.bnr.la
is this a "just write a PR" thing, or a "long and drawn out github issue proposal" thing? I personally DGAF about the name

LAC-Tech!~lewis@granite-phrase.bnr.la
grayhatter: not using @This() sucks when your struct is generic :)

1753230431
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
LAC-Tech: it's probably a thing that I'll do eventually regardless, and an open issue/PR won't affect the decision or timing of it

1753230460
LAC-Tech!~lewis@granite-phrase.bnr.la
got it!

https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/22137 was a step closer to this IMO

andrewrk: starting from commit 76fe518d "std.fs.File.Reader.sendFile: fix EndOfStream detection": my build.zig that runs external commands via .addSystemCommand() has been failing on an assertion down in the new I/O stuff...

1753273951
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
basically, Build/Run.zig's "stdin_writer.interface.sendFileAll(&file_reader, .unlimited)" leads to:

1753273981
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
home/bblack/repos/zig/lib/std/Io/Writer.zig:303:11: 0x148a160 in writableSliceGreedy (std.zig) assert(w.buffer.len >= minimum_length);

1753274022
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
without probably fully understanding what's going on or the most-correct fix, I was able to get things working again with: https://zigbin.io/9015f4

bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
[I would file a bug and a PR, but (a) I know this is a very active ongoing thing you might already be aware of + (b) I'm really not sure this is the right way to fix it, either]

1753274767
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
bah, I was being fooled by some cached command outputs in .zig-cache.  The above did avoid the assertion failure, but it resulted in some truncated file data somewhere in there

1753275164
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
the truncation appears to be happening when writing to .zig-cache/.../stdout from .captureStdOut() of the .addSystemCommand()

1753276391
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
trying to come up with a simpler repro as a build.zig

1753277373

I'll just make a real issue, things are complicated :)

andrewrk: i'm sure you've seen, but just in case: they fixed the llvm bug

1753292981
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
triallax: yeah! idk if you noticed but that was a zig user who did that

1753292992

i did not!

hey ho am checking out zig from time to time, I'm wondering why https://ziglang.org/zsf/ "proudly" links to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ucHARxVbhrBbuZDbhrGHYDTsYAs8_bMH?usp=sharing regarding public finances since the foundation is a 501

1753302405
src!~src@user/src
this is all stale out of date unmaintained info

1753302431
src!~src@user/src
and not to imply anything, but this simply "smells bad" to me (and so, I assume, to others too, most of which will never raise the issue I assume)

1753302515
src!~src@user/src
serious project -> good website -> proudly says it's a 501 w/ public finances -> links to shared google drive folder w/ random docs from 5 years ago

1753302660
src!~src@user/src
k the excel from 2024 has the links to irs.gov and EIN for lookup, but that should probably be the link to begin w/ imo

1753303358
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
src: thanks for pointing it out, will roll out that change along with the 2025 financials blog post

src: what communit(ies) do you hail from?

1753304502
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
out of curiosity

1753304781
src!~src@user/src
andrewrk: work as software dev in machine manufacturing (C++, some scripting langs), privately into C/Linux/embedded and whatever seems fun

1753304870

as for "online communit(ies)" I don't think I'm really part of any at the moment lol
