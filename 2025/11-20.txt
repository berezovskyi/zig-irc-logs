you coming back reminded me to check, and I see that you made it to the osaka zig day! excellent

did the host seem like they were interested in doing more?

1763601774
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
yeah he was really nice and seems interested in getting more involved

rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
it's working..

andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
he's artistic as well as handy. he kept putting himself down but he's doing all this cool stuff like fixing up that shop (including difficult stuff like pouring cement, cutting steel, building furniture, etc) as well as launching an indie game this year

I'm just waiting for Github to get to my report.

man whatever is happening with that completely creeps me out

rvrb: you're right btw... I spent way too much time on this investigation; but he has a long history of typosquatting on cryptocurrency topics, and also owns the github account zigglang

I'm sure the two are unrelated

mountaingoat!~mountaing@user/mountaingoat
can i break from a multi-line if expression?

1763625188
mountaingoat!~mountaing@user/mountaingoat
ok, i see, i can make a block within an if expression

1763625641
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
Yeah, block lables work on if/else blocks

1763648593
reykjalin!7e28cf3a41@user/reykjalin
mountaingoat: yeah you can give the if block itself a label iirc with `if (condition) bloc_label: {`

hey there folks, what's an acceptable pastebin to use to post questions here?

1763656926
jaysonsantos!~jaysonsan@130.61.217.144
i guess i will just use gist.

1763657037
jaysonsantos!~jaysonsan@130.61.217.144
i am trying the new writer/reader interfaces (new to zig) and when i try to write using print and then flushing immediatly, i get an error for bad file descriptor, isn't the right way to use the interface like provider.writer(&buffer).interface.(print|flush)? here is an example of what i am trying to run, that is on macos btw https://gist.github.com/jaysonsantos/4a32329b8c3d284d1d4d2d2cf99fb3b4

1763657099
jaysonsantos!~jaysonsan@130.61.217.144
and also, for the writer, there is the property instance but for reader, it is a function, is that right?

1763657226
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
jaysonsantos: you have to use &writer.interface

1763657289
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
can only use the interface as a pointer to writer.interface (because it accesses the underlying Writer relative in memory)

1763657308
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
this seems to be a very common mistake

1763657449
jaysonsantos!~jaysonsan@130.61.217.144
Gliptic: and is it possible to catch this on compile time? when I do var output = writer.interface; am I moving that reference somehow? I saw that print's signature is w: *Writer, i thought it would use it by reference

1763657492
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
you're copying the interface struct, yes, so that it's no longer inside the Writer struct, and `drain` will find garbage next to it instead

1763657530
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
so sure, you're using print with a pointer, but that pointer is to this copied version

1763657567
jaysonsantos!~jaysonsan@130.61.217.144
got it, and this happens everytime i call a function from the interface or was it only when it was bound to output?

1763657572
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
I'm not sure why it's not a function to access the interface, so that it's forced to return a pointer to it

1763657616
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
jaysonsantos: if you did writer.interface.print(...) it would work as you're calling it with the interface field that's inside the writer

1763657662
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
copying it to output breaks it, yes

1763657871
jaysonsantos!~jaysonsan@130.61.217.144
Gliptic: thanks for the answers! have a good one

1763657884
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
sure, you too

netvor!~netvor@2a00:ca8:a1f:cd0:1d9e:d626:b37:955c
given i have fixed number of keys, can i pre-allocate std.StringHashMapUnmanaged so that i can put/delete keys without allocating every time?  i see there are methods like .putAssumeCapacity.. but i'm not sure how to initialize it

1763659954
netvor!~netvor@2a00:ca8:a1f:cd0:1d9e:d626:b37:955c
oh it looks like .empty and then .ensureTotalCapacity should do the trick
