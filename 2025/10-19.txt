there is this thing going on online called the "zig effect" where ppl try out zig and endup quitting their job to continue learning zig! lol

stealth_ in the "zig effect", do they get paid for coding Zig too?

DanOpcode, probably not unless they are making youtube video or streaming and such.

I took time off from what I was doing as well to learn/code zig. So I can see the point in it. I was using the excuse of I am waiting for the laser to arrive! but it showed up so wont be able to spend much time on zig soon.

Laser?

1760884291
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca

are there any good resources on using addCSourceFiles

1760917493

i heard @cImport was getting removed so im trying to get this module working without it

1760917511
longlonglongint!~longlongl@user/longlonglongint
but whenever i try to use it i get `no module named 'x' available within module 'y'`

1760917558
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
where are you even getting that function name from?

1760917620
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
o for the build.zig

1760917630
longlonglongint!~longlongl@user/longlonglongint
well it actually says 'rsgl_gl' and 'RSGL'

1760917643
longlonglongint!~longlongl@user/longlonglongint
but i figured the actual name doesnt matter

1760917692
longlonglongint!~longlongl@user/longlonglongint
i created a module for rsgl_gl and added some c source files with rsgl_gl.addCSourceFiles

1760917695
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
they removed the namespacing 

1760917715
longlonglongint!~longlongl@user/longlonglongint
i thought they removed usingnamespace

1760917733
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
i mean `usingnamespace`

1760917745
longlonglongint!~longlongl@user/longlonglongint
ive never even used `usingnamespace`

1760917808
longlonglongint!~longlongl@user/longlonglongint
in the main module i put `&.{ .{ .name = "rsgl_gl", .module = rsgl_gl } }`

1760917830
longlonglongint!~longlongl@user/longlonglongint
and for the exe i did `exe.root_module.addImport("RSGL", mod);`

1760917930
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
this is a old code i was working with https://zigbin.io/ff9b4c i was uing .addSourcesFiles successfully 

1760917968
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
but there was other complication so didn't endup using it.

I also don't think you should code ahead of actual feature release time since those features are still broken!

1760918263
longlonglongint!~longlongl@user/longlonglongint
theoretically what im doing should work though
