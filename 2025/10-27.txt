f128 has 34 decimals of precision, so it's more precise than C#'s 28.

sooo yester?day i was trying to make a reproduction case for here, i eventually got it fixed on my main project and it turned out to be because of a hack i did to deal with ANOTHER x86-adjacent bug

1761557539
lemons!~doggie@user/doggie-:49517
on x86-windows it generates wrong code for extern structs of bitsize u64, so i swapped the definition for a packed struct instead

1761557598
lemons!~doggie@user/doggie-:49517
as it turns out, that only works on x86-windows, on x86-linux it makes the arguments parse incorrectly

entertaining writing a Zig native Vulkan allocator library, since I get the feeling it is a lot harder than I think it is and that is always a good thing for learning what I don't know

rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.228
stealth_: I think it would do you well to pause and take a more generous interpretation of people who piss you off. one way to see that interview, is that Richard was as excited as you might be to talk to Andrew about programming. maybe it wasn't fun to watch, but that's no reason to be angry  

1761595530
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1

rvrb, feeling angry is natural part of human nature. unless you are a robot! i am not a robot. as for wether i should feel angry or not part, all i say is; even buddha would have been angry.

1761596336
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.228
stealth_: consider that anger is a response to an underlying more primitive emotion: fear, anxiety, sadness. wielding it reactively is disrespectful. a more respectful approach is to first break it down and understand it. then your response can be measured.

I'll start a new topic then. I've been reading about Forth lately and implementing my own system on an RP2350. What insanity level do I have for thinking it might be cool to implement a Zig compiler in Forth for bootstrapping? You wouldn't even have to depend on C, just a Forth machine which can have a pretty minimal footprint of things you need to port between systems.

1761601039
reykjalin!7e28cf3a41@user/reykjalin
No, it wasn’t that bad. It was an interesting conversation between two language authors. It did heavily skew towards Richard talking about his ideas for Roc and how they intersect with the Zig compiler, but that didn’t make it a bad conversation.

1761601052
reykjalin!7e28cf3a41@user/reykjalin
I think the people complaining about it just wanted more Zig content. That’s a somewhat fair expectation since the podcast episode is framed as an interview with you, but it was probably a fantastic listen for people interested in language design or Roc.

1761601072

1761601347

I think reykjalin hit a very important point, the vitirol is probably influenced by a percived lack of authoritative zig discussions

I'm also unconvinced PR reviews is the right format, I just picked it as a reference to a joke you made last time that reviewing PRs on stream is unlikely to result in net fewer open PRs :D

1761604568

comptime is deterministic, no syscalls or interacting with files

1761604672
mattnite!~mattnite@172.103.236.154
You could probably do something in the build system to generate a file, but I wouldn't suggest it. You're trying to write software one way, and Zig is really trying to tell you to write it another. Let Zig guide you.

does a zig compiler version change not invalidate the cache?

1761606061
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.228
grayhatter: I asked a similar question and I believe the answer was the version string is the cache invalidation, so on a Git commit recompiles wouldn’t invalidate until you made a new commit

1761606089

Of the compiler, if you are doing compiler dev

clevor!sid649024@id-649024.hampstead.irccloud.com
I personally use a lightly modified Sway config with the unused shortcuts removed, and it has worked well, aside from this one bug related to touchpad tapping that occasionally occurs. 

1761606140
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.228
grayhatter: that was the outcome of when I asked the same question as well

1761606162
clevor!sid649024@id-649024.hampstead.irccloud.com
Ideally, it should be based on the hash of the compiler binary.

1761606262
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I was sure that I had used zig-wayland with 0.15, but when I just tried to use it again in a sister project, it wouldn't compile because zig-wayland was still on v0.3 Which made me assume that it was using the cached objects built with zig 0.14, because the 0.3 build.zig wouldn't compile

1761606338
clevor!sid649024@id-649024.hampstead.irccloud.com
andrewrk: Did you meet Adrien Bertrand at Zigtoberfest?

1761606339
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I'd assumed that in part because I just had to delete a bunch of .zig-cache dir's to reclaim disk space, and deleting that cache broke zls syntax highlighting

1761606447
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
but now I doubt my understanding, because there was a commit I'd forgotten about in a different directory... so, this will just be the 4 out of 4th time that I've doubted zig's caching and been wrong... one day I'll get over the PTSD from every other caching system and I might actually believe that zig's works correctly

1761606852
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
clevor: yes I believe so
