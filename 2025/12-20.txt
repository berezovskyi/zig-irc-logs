 so hase the ship sailed. or do y'all think it's possible that zig can replace rust in the kernel some day? it seems like a much better fit honestly

I don't disagree but I don't think anyone here has any influence over the linux kernel project

hmm. What should i use for skipping bytes in Reader? I see a lot of .discard* functions but not sure which one to use… I think two general ones are .discard() and .discardAll() right? I guess i'll try .discardAll() first

1766196610
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
discard() can discard fewer than the amount requested

1766196635
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
discardAll() is higher level, discards exactly how many you asked, returns void

interesting. I wonder how to turn a slice into an array… I want to convert 4 bytes of a file into a u32. I have it like this but it doesn't work: const length_bytes = try reader.take(4); const length = std.mem.readInt(u32, length_bytes, .big);

well it doesn't compile i mean

you should be able to use `reader.takeInt` to consume the int directly

1766198637

e.g. https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.15.2/std/#std.Io.Reader.takeInt

ohhhh i see

fwiw, you can get an array from a slice by slicing with comptime known bounds, which will give you a pointer to an array. so e.g. the type of `my_slice[0..4]` is actually `*const [4]u8` (assuming `my_slice` is `[]const u8`). You can dereference this to get the underlying array

1766198882
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
e.g. `const my_array: [4]u8 = my_slice[0..4].*;`

does anyone use latest versions of zig and zls off each of their master branches? Having trouble building zls rev a3241acd with zig@0.16.0-dev.1632+5fa7f1308.

1766199980
jack__d!~jack__d@pool-71-127-206-84.nwrknj.fios.verizon.net
ah I figured it out (https://github.com/zigtools/zls/pull/2526)

is there something wrong with std.log.debug()? For some reason it changes how my program behaves. For example when i have no .debug() it segfaults immediately when i try to run it, but if i do have the .debug() functions it starts, and after a bit throws an integer overflow error. My program is definitely broken but i don't get why the .debug() functions fix it for a bit

snowflr, sounds like stack corruption, the problem is likely elsewhere

1766225168
snowflr!~sunflr@user/sunflr
yeah that sounds like it i think

There's something I don't understand here. I changed the build.zig like this: https://gist.github.com/MimiValsi/fc4b5a62a4a3056ce403abeed0a821da And now when compiling, I get this error on the first file: "error: root source file struct 'std' has no member named 'stringArrayHashMap'" . How come?

Tried to change 'createModule' to 'addModule' and the problem remains. weird
