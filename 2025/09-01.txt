when setting a const's value to the result of an if expression, can I use nested ifs in said expression?

(about to try now too)

tsujp!497e1f7b6a@sourcehut/user/tsujp
it seems you can so long as you annotate the top-level block e.g. `blk: { ... }` and then in the inner if break using that annotation to return the value `break :blk 123;`

usually if i want a rust-style expression block I find myself using blk: and break :blk <value>

you can nest ifs if they don't have {}s though, https://zigbin.io/cfa9fb

watch for dangling else I suppose

1756731010
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
yeah, it's less about the if itself and more about one line expressions vs blocks

1756731029
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
a block can only return a value via the labelled break thing

1756731073
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
sometimes nesting switch can be a little easier to read than nesting ifs, IMHO

Just out of curiosity... I recall that as soon as Windows 7 was unsupported, Zig stopped supporting it. Will the same policy be in effect for Win 10 next month?

1756758558
squeek502!~squeek502@user/squeek502
cr1901, the basic idea is that support for older windows versions is up to contributors: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/7242#issuecomment-2267626996

1756758715
squeek502!~squeek502@user/squeek502
until there is an Windows 11-specific API that zig wants to use, zig will continue to support windows 10, unsure exactly how it'll be dealt with once there's a dependency on something windows 11-specific (i.e. will the official binaries be built targeting windows 10? will there be a runtime switch to allow the binary to use either API? etc)

1756759699

squeek502: one problem is that we have to choose whether to claim support or not. and if we claim support, that means automated testing needs to test that version

1756762848
squeek502!~squeek502@user/squeek502
andrewrk, true, unfortunately the simplest path is just to mark windows 10 as unsupported but i think that's a bad direction to go. I'm kind of resigned to it being inevitable though, and Microsoft definitely wants it to happen

why use something like ZVM when you can spend 6 months learning a new expression language required for your package manager, fighting daily battles with development environments for every project you want to contribute to, taking on the challenge of upstreaming those fixes and convincing the maintainers they're worth it, getting nerd sniped into

1756763430
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.229
installing the operating system built on top of that package manager, then uninstalling it because everything breaks every time you try to update; but congratulate yourself on your hermetically pure, reproducible(*) environment that supposedly saves time debugging differences in your system? signed, a nix enthusiast

1756763457
squeek502!~squeek502@user/squeek502
clevor, yeah imo the hardware requirements of windows 11 making it so not everyone can use it even if they wanted to is the best reason for zig to want to continue supporting windows 10
