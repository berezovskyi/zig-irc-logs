Dir (like cwd() here) handles opening absolute paths fine

1751539089
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
that's really cool

do yall have any tips/suggested libraries/sample code for learning how to make a wayland status bar in zig? i'm looking at other bars to try to get a feel for how they do stuff but i dont want to copy them exactly

1751548318
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
tldr basically i miss yambar and want to make a bar in zig instead of using waybar

1751548633
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
I mean, I'd use zig-wayland of course

1751548648
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
the trickest part will probably be text rendering (assuming you want text)

1751548905
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
yeah

1751548939
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
all the zig bars im finding are specifically for river but i currently use niri so at minimum i want to be able to display niri workspaces

1751548977
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
creek wayland bar is simple

1751548991
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
ive just never written a bar before so like finding a simple example/tutorial would probably help get me started lol

1751548995
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
alright ill look at it

1751549010
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
https://github.com/nmeum/creek

1751549032
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
thanks

1751549263
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
now to figure out how to make it work with niri

1751549330
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
yea, creek is still for river, but its codebase is really simple, so I thought it could be a good starter to learn how to make a bar in zig

1751549352
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
ah ok gotcha

1751549393
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
yeah the main things i want are workspaces, mpd module, volume, backlight, battery, kbd layout, and date/time so i gotta learn how to do those

1751549402
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
plus config stuff for colors and stuff

1751549412
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
this is gonna be more involved than i thought lmao

1751549438
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
I think the only river features are for the tags (virtual screens if you like)

1751549446
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
I think the remaining can be used as is

1751549683
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
oh ok

1751550119
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
hmm i think its trying to connect to river and then failing cause i removed the tag stuff and its crashing when i try to run it

1751550124
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
ill work on it later

1751550129
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
thanks for the tips and help

1751550142

Can riverwm support the tag functionality of dwm?

1751550740
meidam!~meidam@user/meidam
I've tried river breifly, but don't really remember why I didn't continue using it. I have gotten too used to dwm...

1751550835
leon-p!1b22ab9492@user/leon-p
pretty sure river tags work exactly like dwm tags, although it has been years since I've used dwm. You can check the river wiki, we have a high-level description of how tags work there

1751550926
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
i just got really used to niri's scrolling window management tbh

1751550947
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
I'm sure we diverge from dwm in some ways, mostly by accident

1751550967
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
I didn't really try that hard to copy the behavior exactly, I just did what I thought made sense

1751551011
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
In any case, I working on deleting all the window management code in river :D

1751551663
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
aw i just ran the zig hello wayland example and it displays a kitty!!

1751551667
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
i love that

1751551679
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
:)

1751551723
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
i wonder if someone's done a scrolling layout generator for river

1751551759
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
well, you can't with river 0.3.x. The stuff I'm working on for river 0.4.x will make that kind of thing possible though

1751551777
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
except it will be called a window manager not a layout generator at that point

1751551806
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
look at my way too big PR: https://codeberg.org/river/river/pulls/1100

1751551872
meidam!~meidam@user/meidam
ifreund: What do you mean by "I working on deleting all teh window management code in river"? Isn't river specifically for window management?

1751551907
meidam!~meidam@user/meidam
Where will the window management code be located instead then?

1751551910
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
meidam: river is a wayland compositor

1751551927
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
the window management code is getting pushed out into a separate window manager process

1751551948
meidam!~meidam@user/meidam
Don't most wayland compositors do window management as well though?

1751551965
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
Yes, river is doing something different

1751551991
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
I want it to be easier to write window managers for wayland

1751552004
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
and I want to write them in high level dynamic languages without destroying latency

1751552017
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
the compositor is the performance sensitive part, not the window manager

1751552021
meidam!~meidam@user/meidam
I've seen wayland compositors the name for window managers, when it's a wayland one instead of an X11 one. Except wayland compositors of course have the compositor built in, since it's actually a compositor first i guess

1751552038
meidam!~meidam@user/meidam
ifreund: Ah okay

1751552067
meidam!~meidam@user/meidam
Isn't river also built on top of wlroots?

1751552089
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
yeah

1751552096
meidam!~meidam@user/meidam
Sorry, I'll just look in the faq on your site for this kind of stuff. I imagine it's all there

1751552121
meidam!~meidam@user/meidam
I think I've read some of it before. I just forget some of it

1751552189
meidam!~meidam@user/meidam
I do remember it being pretty cool that you can configure riverwm with whichever programmin language you want

1751552323
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
ifreund: re: 0.4.x, that sounds really cool!

1751554075
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
hmm now to figure out how to add text that can update to this cat picture sample

1751554682
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
maybe i should do something simpler until i figure out what im doing...

1751558851
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
https://zigbin.io/674eaa i want to read and write to a socket but i dont get any output, what am i doing wrong?

1751558913
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
JetpackJackson: I think you misunderstand how sockets work

1751558952
Ayo!~Ayo@45.142.232.203
JetpackJackson: readAll() blocks until it has read the full 1024 bytes

1751558958
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
oh

1751558973
tranzystorekk!86175ff574@voidlinux/maintainer/tranzystorekk
is the zig show online? twitch says offline

1751559011
tranzystorekk!86175ff574@voidlinux/maintainer/tranzystorekk
hm, just some short placeholder recording from 5 mins ago

1751559076
Ayo!~Ayo@45.142.232.203
ACTION is furiously refreshing the stream

1751559086
tranzystorekk!86175ff574@voidlinux/maintainer/tranzystorekk
aha, here we go

1751559109
Ayo!~Ayo@45.142.232.203
nothing here yet

1751559164
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
JetpackJackson: you're not going to read from the socket the data that you just sent on the socket

1751559181
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
if that's what you were trying

1751559260
tranzystorekk!86175ff574@voidlinux/maintainer/tranzystorekk
ok, i don't have msg edit field in twitch chat

1751559264
tranzystorekk!86175ff574@voidlinux/maintainer/tranzystorekk
weird

1751559285
tranzystorekk!86175ff574@voidlinux/maintainer/tranzystorekk
is it in some restricted mode?

1751559351
tranzystorekk!86175ff574@voidlinux/maintainer/tranzystorekk
ok apparently the stream got cut off and i was watching another short recording

1751559558
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
no im trying to get the response from the socket

1751559569
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
all right

1751559587
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/IPC#programmatic-access

1751559611
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
but did you expect some response from "testing"?

1751559625
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
yeah

1751559629
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
an error response

1751559633
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
:P, I guess

1751559713
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
but you didn't send a newline

1751559723
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
so it's a complete request

1751559730
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
*it's _not_ a

1751559758
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
I would expect it to not respond until you send a whole line

1751561137
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
ohh ok

1751561139
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
that was it

1751561564
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
so its returning the number of bytes read, how do i get the actual content?

1751561635
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
buf[0..n[

1751561639
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
s/[/]

1751562447
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
ok cool

1751562452
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
now to parse the data

1751562511
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
is there a json parser in the stdlib?

1751562552
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
yes

1751562936
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
cool beans

1751562976
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
https://zigbin.io/86cdc7

1751562980
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
now i get this

1751563058
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
by default it's going to error on fields it doesn't recognize

1751563094
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
but also, the response doesn't correspond to your Workspace struct at all

1751563128
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
also, you're supposed to actually use the length that socket.read returns

1751563133
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
oh

1751563141
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
n is not the length of the response

1751563152
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
how do i have it ignore the initial "Ok" and "Workspaces" labels

1751563162
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
and also... one .read doesn't necessarily read the whole response, you have to read until the newline

1751563178
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
JetpackJackson: by not ignoring it

1751563185
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
make a struct that has that

1751563214
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
how do i get the length of socket.read without having the buffer length already

1751563224
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
you said how yourself

1751563236
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
<JetpackJackson> so its returning the number of bytes read, how do i get the actual content?

1751563240
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
but i cant set up the buffer without the length

1751563266
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
but the length of the buffer is not the length of the response read

1751563436
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
alright i think i understand

1751563439
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
possibly

1751563455
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
hmm i dont want the "Ok" inside my workspace struct tho

1751563715
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
im stuck again https://zigbin.io/c0f1f2

1751563770
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
Case sensitive

1751563814
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
You should probably rethink your de-structuring though

1751563854
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
Your struct is shaped like const struct Ok = struct { Workspaces: []Workspace }

1751563899
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
how would you recommend i do it then? ive never done this before

1751563925
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
To start, I would make a struct that matches the shape of your data

1751563935
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
ok

1751563938
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
Get that to work. Then I would I work on slimming it down to only get the data you need / want

1751563961
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
You might want to start with custom json rather than a response so you get the hang of it

1751564001
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
IE try to parse {"Ok": "Hello, World!"} into a struct

1751564019
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
Then {"Ok": ["Hello", "World"]}

1751564025
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
etc

1751564035
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
ok ill put those into a test

1751564064
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
are there raw strings in zig

1751564072
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
so i can have the test json as a string

1751564174
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
Yep, you need to escape double quotes or you can use the multiline string syntax

1751564214
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
const msg = "{\"Ok\": \"Hello, world!\"}";

1751564281
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
alright

1751564399
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
is there a way to see how zig is seeing the json?

1751564417
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
what do you mean with that?

1751564426
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
i made a second struct for the response itself and it contains the result code (Ok or Err) and the workspaces but its still saying UnknownField

1751564438
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
so i want to see what zig is seeing in the json

1751564450
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
as I said before, it will by default error on unknown fields

1751564463
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
right but i want to see what that field is

1751564532
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
I don't know that there's a way to print that

1751564578
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
but it should be pretty obvious by comparing your structs with the json you parse

1751564656
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
how does your current structs look like?

1751564748
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
https://zigbin.io/b71eb9

1751564765
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
JetpackJackson: where is "Ok"?

1751564784
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
it goes into the "Code:" part of Response

1751564788
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
no it doesn't

1751564808
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
huh?

1751564810
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
the json looked like: { "Ok": ... } did it not?

1751564815
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
yeah

1751564817
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
but there's no Ok in Response

1751564826
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
so "Ok" is going to be an unknown field

1751564839
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
ok if i change Code to Ok it'll work then?

1751564844
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
No

1751564846
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
well, no

1751564852
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
Workspaces was a field of Ok

1751564877
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
your structs must correspond 1:1 to the json

1751564881
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
const Response = struct { Ok: struct {Workspaces: []Workspace}}}

1751564885
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
so do i need like another struct

1751564888
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
oh

1751564893

each field in the struct is a field in a json object

1751564929
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
now i get UnexpectedToken

1751564992
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
is the json you're parsing complete?

1751565003
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
yeah

1751565006
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
as I said before, one .read isn't necessarily going to read the whole thing

1751565031
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
yeah ill have to fix that but for now i just have it as a big number

1751565058
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
well

1751565067
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
is this the json you get: https://zigbin.io/c0f1f2 ?

1751565072
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
because it sure doesn't look complete to me

1751565124
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
oh that was with the wrong buffer size

1751565132
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
i have it as 256*4 now

1751565174
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
lemme send a paste real quick and then i gotta eat a snack cause i lowkey forgot about food

1751565184
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
well, if you get UnexpectedToken from the json parser, odds are it's not valid json

im just trying to follow this: https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/IPC#programmatic-access

1751565411
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
ok, I think UnexpectedToken can also come from type mismatch

1751565424
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
"name": null isn't going to be parseable as an []u8

1751565425
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
Yeah your name type is worng

1751565435
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
output as well

1751565444
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
name should be ?[]const u8 since it is nullable

1751565449
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
active_window_id too

1751565459
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
Isn't that an int?

1751565463
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
Oh I see

1751565465
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
it has a null

1751565466
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
it's null at least in one

1751565498
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
output isn't null in any, but you'll have to check whether it can be

1751565506
rockorager!~rockorage@2600:3c06::f03c:94ff:fea6:1f08
The unexepected token is probably because it expects a double quote but gets a null

1751565517
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
but yeah, it should be []const

1751565599
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
ok im trying that and its still erroring, i made the name, output, and active_win into ?[]const u8

1751565641
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
I didn't say active_window_id should be ?[]const u8

1751565685
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
i saw you write "active_window_id too" and thought that meant change it

1751565709
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
yeah, I see the misunderstanding

1751565716
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
that was in response to "name type is wrong"

1751565726
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
oh

1751565735
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
as you can see, active_window_id is never as tring

1751565737
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
*a string

1751565749
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
you'll have to look at the json (and the docs) and decide which types they should be

1751565763
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
hmm active_win can be null

1751565798
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
YAY it works

1751565805
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
i did ?u32 for active_win

1751565809
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
thank you all so much

1751565837
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
👍

1751566913
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
hmm now im looking again and theres an "event stream" command ("niri msg --json event-stream") that keeps outputting events, how would i read that continuously? i cant really allocate a buffer for it cause the size would just keep growing

1751567055
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
also is there a way to sort the contents of the struct? for example sorting by the idx of the workspaces 

1751567112
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
sounds like you want to sort the Workspaces slice?

1751567200
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
yeah something like that

1751567221
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
stdlib has ways to sort slices, yes

IO, channels, select: great stuff.

1751572111
flower_!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
In Go you can send something to a channel, but when you forgot to make your channel, your app just hangs

1751572278
flower_!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
deadlocked (is that the word?) goroutines can be hard to debug in my experience

1751575699
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
ok i think i want to switch to using the event stream, is there a way to like only pick up specific event types? and how should i read the data without creating an infinitely large buffer 

1751576388
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
you read it line by line (assuming it's send the same way)

1751576405
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
*sent

1751576915
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
it outputs stuff like this: https://paste.debian.net/1384226/

1751577569
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
so, yes, read line by line

1751577590
Gliptic!~glip@2a01:4f8:c012:91f3::1
you only need a buffer big enough for the current line

1751578784

ill have to change my structs too

Will we ever be able to cross compile to illumos?  I think probably not right?

1751580800
lemons!~doggie@user/doggie-:49517
that reminds me but is there any way to redefine a struct (take a type and make a new type where x field has a default value of y, f.e)?
