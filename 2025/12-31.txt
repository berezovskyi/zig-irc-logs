how do i go about understanding when i need to @alignCast a @fieldParentPtr? it seems like on some architectures it needs it

Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
hm, shouldn't the field parent's alignment be at least as much as the child's alignment?

1767172336
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
ah, but then, "at least" - it could still require more alignment

1767172377
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
pretty much, in cases where the parent's alignment requirement > the child's

Hey, I'm trying to use "zig c++" to compile VulkanSceneGraph and VulcanSvenegraph tutorial, I want to do this to write code for my game later in zig based on Vulcanscenegraph. The compiler C++ code terminates immidientlay with "constructor call on misaligned adress for type 'vsg::Options' which requires 16byte alignment"

nephele!~vision@i59F516FB.versanet.de
I assume that this crash is because of additional runtime checking zig adds to the build, maybe with ubsan. How can I debug this? or should I just not use zig c++ for this?

nephele: is the error being reported for your code, or third party code?

1767222509
nephele!~vision@i59F516FB.versanet.de
third party code, in the vsg sourcecode itself

1767222513
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
the default can be overridden, but first it would be diligent to determine if you should try to fix the issue. it could be saving you from a nasty bug

1767222589
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
the flag to override this is `-fno-sanitize=undefined`. I recommend to set this *only* on third-party code as a workaround (ideally after reporting a bug!)

Yes, if this is a bug reporting it would be good. I don't have a way to report it though :/ I don't see a way to contact vsg without github, and i don't have one

nephele: Zig is also on codeberg, albeit similar issue I reckon
