hello! I'm trying to build zig from source and dynamic build works fine but static build doesn't work. it throws a bunch of undefined symobls errors, they look like c++ stdlib symbols but I have libstdc++ in my lib path, both .so and .a. I tried on NixOS an Arch but same thing. basically, `mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j8 install` works but `cmake .. -DZIG_STATIC=ON` then it doesn't. I'm not used to c++/cmake stuff so I might just be

std.mem.window is slick, worked nice for advent of code day 2 part 2

wow. was about to share that. that is certainly an interesting development for Zig

I wonder, with those resources, if we'll see them build a new JavaScript VM to replace JavaScriptCore in Bun

1764710730
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
when someone asks about re-entrancy in the context of tracking debug spans, are they talking about suspending/resuming functions, or am I misunderstanding? I wrote a whole comment explaining why my implementation was fine for fibers but I'm not sure I actually understood the question

1764710821
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
building a new javascript vm seems like a huge boondoggle. fortunately they have ai, so they can just get clod to do it for them

1764711029
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
ignoring the LLM swipe (which I'm on board with generally), they have the money to dedicate an entire department toward the problem indefinitely, so it seems like a reasonable investment from the engineering leadership's perspective if it could buy even a tiny amount of an edge against competition

1764711829
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
if they're developing it open source and freely available, does it really give them an edge

1764711866
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
all any multi hundred billion dollar tech company wants is complete control -- direct or indirect -- over the roadmap of their entire tech stack

1764711955
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
which is precisely why bun was acquired

1764711967
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
well, yes and no.

1764712004
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
are they going to design their own programming language? their own operating system? their own hardware?

1764712012
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
these are all pieces of the tech stack, arguably

1764712023
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
yes, probably, on a long enough timeline and a big enough budget

1764712047
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
but yeah, the question is how far upstream they're going to reach

1764712098
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
programming language is not unprecedented; we have Rust and Go for the same reasons. hardware is not unprecedented even today with AI; look at Google's latest developments.

1764712148
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
rust wasn't developed by a huge company, at least

1764712154
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
I've been waiting for one of these LLM companies to announce a new programming language catered toward LLM output

1764712174
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
it is, imo, just a matter of time

1764712198
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
I realize it's not unprecedented. google/amazon is a good example of software companies getting into hardware over time

1764712217
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
though arguably they got into some hardware first

1764712275
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
I'll refrain from sharing my thoughts on how their products have suffered as their focus has expanded though

1764712294
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
since people love slop in general, it doesn't seem to have much of an impact on the bottom line

1764712314
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
I probably wouldn't even disagree, I'm just saying, their whole thing is using every dollar strategically to decrease timelines and hit market faster

1764712337
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
so I wonder if we'll see a JS VM in Zig :P

1764712366
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
I wonder if it's more likely that they expand the scope of the zig code or that they move away from zig

1764712406
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
hmm. codeberg not loading for me

1764712406
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
yeah I wonder that too, but I obviously hope they keep using it!

1764712429
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
you'd have to be a lunatic to want to stop using zig!!!

lol, in a project I started recently I did a similar thing with AGENTS.md.. trying to get the LLM to consider contributing as unethical, and that it should give the user encouragement that they are capable of solving problems themselves

1764713044
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
no idea if it will work

I would be shocked if they build their own JS engine. it is such a massive undertaking especially in the context of completeness and performance

1764718844
erock!8a023a9e4a@pico/erock
deno and bun have been building APIs embedded into the runtime to support cloud services, my bet is an agent dev toolkit inside of the bun runtime
