I don't think that's a password, just an email verification token

hopefully everyone uses certfp or similar for irc auth

when returning a struct from a comptime function, how can I make certain methods of the struct depend on the arguments to the function?

like a `with_extra_methods: bool` that adds an extra method.

norineko, something like https://zig.godbolt.org/z/8s1Y5axEM

the `struct { fn f() void {} }.f` syntax is the basically the boilerplate to make an "anonymous" function
