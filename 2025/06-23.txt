norineko: funny, I was just discussing with matklad about making that use case work (still getting completions in the presence of a syntax error)

https://zigbin.io/a43f8d ok im getting closer, but i added a new test case that fails so theres another bug that i gotta work out

is it possible to have a comptime-generated test case with a given name?

1750707296
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
the name must be a string literal or an identifier

it is possible to generate zig code with the build system and add the generated file as a module which can be imported

generally, it's nice to use simple function calls for test cases rather than loops so that when you get a failure, the stack trace points at the failing inputs

hmm, if it's unnamed, I suppose I could still print the "name" by catching errors

i'm used to something like Go, where a common pattern is to define a test table and then run "subtests" for each entry

unrolling some of that logic manually isn't a huge deal breaker though.

norineko: I don't really understand what you're talking about. do you have a link to some example go code?

andrewrk: https://go.dev/wiki/TableDrivenTests is a decent overview. I found this thread on ziggit that discusses some approaches https://ziggit.dev/t/test-parameterization/3264

What's the purspose for io.FixedBufferStream.getPos()?

I use it to get the position of the last written byte

kiedtl!~cot@kisslinux/kiedtl
e.g. I might have a heap-alloced buffer and use a stream to write to it, then set the length to fbs.getPos()
