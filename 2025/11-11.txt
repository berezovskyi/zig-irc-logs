besides zig's selling point isn't memory safety, it's code correctness

thank you for the laugh. it really does genuinely make me sad how many developers have resigned themselves to believe that they are incapable of ever writing low level code without the compiler telling them it knows better

1762821552
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
once I read something in defense of rust, where this 3rd author had said, "I guess I'm just not [good/smart] enough" that, paired with how many people enjoy the support of AI, that kinda broke my previous world view

1762821621
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
it never occured to me, that people who I'd ostensibly call makers, or creators, or hackers, would rather be told what to do and what to think

1762821706
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I used to be sadder about it; but lately I'm starting to move into the acceptance phase of just how many people need to be told want to do, and what to think.

makes it easier to reserve my time helping people who believe they can improve, and are willing to try

I want to embed an LLM into the binary, but I might hit some sort of limit in terms of how large I can easily make it.

Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
I recall PE files on windows having some 32 bit limits somewhere, but you can always just append data to it, with a trailing length suffix.

1762837932
daurnimator!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
clevor: zip files are identified by footer. you can probably make a PE + zip file

1762838090
daurnimator!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
alternatively I wonder if you can do iso9660 with PE files. You can with ELF (that's what an AppImage does)

1762843840
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
I'd expect you could

1762843928
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
Though you'd have to carve out space in the PE for the structures that have to be at a known offset, naturally.

1762843944
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
Didn't know that about appimage, that's pretty clever

i think 0.15.2 is missing from https://github.com/ziglang/zig/releases ?

1762844671
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
A few people have mentioned quirks with 0.15.2 around docs as well. I've just stuck with 0.15.1

1762845485
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
If I need multiple read "cursors" within a file, can I duplicate std.fs.File.Readers at the various offsets? Or should I manually track offsets and seek myself?

1762845594
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
hm, but then I'd also need to track the end of the various "slices" of the file. Is Reader guaranteed to clamp reads beyond .size?

1762846048
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
Well, guess I could wrap that in Io.Reader.Limited, but this feels like it's approaching a level of complexity that I'd be better off just doing it myself.

1762846074
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
Less memory burn if someone throws a file with a million records at me, too, I suppose...

1762851971
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
0.15.2 was intentionally not given a github release as far as I understand and future versions are unlikely to get that either

1762855675
Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
damn it all, burned by a bug in 0.15.1's broken File.seek*()

3 hours of debugging, down to disasm, good fun

github releases are meaningless lock-in to a proprietary platform that is being steadily enshittified

1762869303
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
ziglang.org is the cannonical location to find releases

1762869406
sunflr!~sunflr@user/sunflr
oh, thought there was something more

1762870669
daurnimator!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
ifreund: that's fine if you've never used them before. but at present github proclaims "0.15.1 is the latest release". We should delete all the old github releases so that it hides that and shows the latest tag instead

1762872179
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
daurnimator: that might break a lot of existing things that reference those old github release / download URIs

1762872276
daurnimator!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
bblack: indeed. which is something that probably needs to happen. otherwise we should keep making github releases. Just stopping making new releases without deleting all the old ones is worse than both options

1762876648

Also fix the Changes link on ziglanh

phantom2!~phantom@user/phantom2
I'm playing with comptime and have a question. I have an argument to a function, `comptime field: std.meta.FieldEnum(MyStruct)`, and I am trying to see if I can identify the return type, but `@TypeOf(@field(MyStruct, @tagName(field)))` correctly identifies the tag name but says it does not exist in the struct. I suspect this is because it is being performed on the struct type not an instance of it.

1762879408
phantom2!~phantom@user/phantom2
I've tried other approaches, like passing the return type in the argument which works and iterating through the fields, but trying to see if there is another way.

1762879741
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
phantom2: you can do `const foo: MyStruct = undefined; ... @Typeof(@field(foo, "fieldname"))`

1762879773
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
slightly ugly, but conceptually straightforward

Am I missing something? How do I cross compile a statically linked linux binary from macOS? `sudo zig cc init/init.c -target aarch64-linux-gnu` emits a dynamically linked bin

1762882036
