if I contribute to a project, but I am not officially maintainer, can I do code reviews ? O_o

I've really got to remember not to use LSP rename with zig. old fashioned search and replace works better

1748920048
Drixtan!~Drixtan@user/Drixtan
ah, I do rename all the time, but if you say so

LAC-Tech: like the variable renaming feature? Why?

1748920162
LAC-Tech!~lewis@granite-phrase.bnr.la
sunflr: it can rename some thing, but not others. It has trouble with things like enum tags, or renmaing things used across different files. then it misses some. then you just "clean up" the rest by hand. then you mis a spot

hmm yeah it does act weird sometimes

I integrated this ripgrep thing into Neovim so I could search the tigerbeetle codebase :)

sunflr!~sunflr@user/sunflr
yeah ripgrep is useful for stuff like that :3

has anyone written a linux kernel module in zig?

grayhatter: if you are doing something, even just a PoC, I am interested to see / can you share :)

Drixtan: if I get something that's not embarrising, I'll post it

1748924749
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I'll probably post it in any case; because why not... but I'm writing a kernel module to function as an oomd that doesn't behave like a lobotomized koala

grayhatter, drixtan: I did a long time ago. Looks like https://github.com/orgs/ziglang/projects/5 still exists

I figured out I could use readLink, but my solution caused a compiler crash. https://github.com/myclevorname/narser/commit/fb67f9dcfb9ad88238c597ee0c6366cdd4fd4dd3 https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/HclwKJZr/

if I do it, it'll be because of your work, so I really apprecate that!

or, rather your gist

I refactored the code to get Zig to not crash.

grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
clevor: I'd be interested in the diff that doesn't cause a compiler crash

That's in the master branch.
