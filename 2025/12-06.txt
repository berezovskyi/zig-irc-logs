 hi all, wondering if anyone has already figured out a nice way to get vim to recognize the inside of zig's captured |...| like it does for e.g. ci' for '...'? ty <3

hi all, I'm trying to do today's advent of code to learn zig. I have something like this https://paste.sr.ht/~williewillus/8fa6625aa79f4ad6b37a63821e0a24a7fece7b88 where I want to do one thing with a non-error and one thing in the case of error. I get a compile error pointing to parseInt saying that this is a error!u64 but an optional type is expected and that I should try using "try", "catch", or "if". But this is basically an example

given in the language docs (handle_all_error_scenarios.zig and handle_some_error_scenarios.zig) so I'm wondering why this doesn't work when the language reference says it should

in the meantime i can probably work around with `catch` but want to see what I'm missing here

you need `else |err|` to handle the error, or at least `else |_|` to ignore it

just out of curiosity .. is there any resource (blog post, podcast, etc.) about history of Zig in terms of influences of other languages?  (mostly "who influenced Zig" but also the other way around)?

(i was also thinking of asking on ziggit but there does not seem to be a fitting category)

doc question: shouldnt the word "forward" be "backward" instead? https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.array_list.AlignedManaged.orderedRemove

mortmann: I can see why it would be interpreted that way. It's ambiguous, because "forward" could be interpreted as "closer to the end" or as "closer to the beginning"

andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
in the end, the ambiguity is resolved by the wrong interpretation not making any sense to exist as a function :)

i wonder whether more ppl would think "forward" or "backward" in this case. i found "forward" quite irritating when i expected sharp / precise / unambiguous wording.

I agree that ambiguous language should be avoided in doc comments

I interpret forward as being "toward the front of the list" but I can see it being somewhat confusing, since forward iteration usually means iterating toward the end of the list
