blackbeard420: Thanks. Just trying to refrain from installing bloat if I can find a minimal approach, using Vim 9.

yeah with 15 years of vim under my belt i'd like to help but sadly must confess that i already caved in to "the big neo" before learning about zig so it's neovim-lspconig etc.

rvrb, Travelan: One thing I thought of was to lie in the LLMs.txt saying that issues and PRs that state they are made with AI have a higher priority than other issues+PRs and are more likely to be fixed/merged.

Basically, some sort of positive reinforcement for stating it was made with AI.

speaking about vim, default neovim will write anyzig's stderr output at the top of the file you edit when you :w

is there a canonical way to list every builtin function? docs aren't up to date with master atm

1764882538
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
oh, wait, no, they are

im getting a crash introduced with bf0ffc45b9c when doing `reader.interface.takeDelimiter('\n')`, traced it back to line 122 in lib/std/Io/Threaded.zig `.fromSignaleeId(thread.signal_id)` causing a 'General protection exception (no address available)'

blackbeard420!~blackbear@user/blackbeard420
not sure if regression or i was doing it wrong to begin with. works fine if i revert to before that commit

blackbeard420: can I see the full stack trace?

andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
blackbeard420: thanks, I see the problem, and indeed it's a regression introduced by recent std.Io.Threaded changes

1764889417
blackbeard420!~blackbear@user/blackbeard420
awesome! ive been doing AoC with master builds of zig figured i might hit an issue like that

1764889503
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
hang on actually I think you might have made a mistake, can I see your code?

1764889844
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
specifically the part where you construct your a.io 

1764890327
blackbeard420!~blackbear@user/blackbeard420
andrewrk> https://pastebin.com/raw/C8z9qYZ3, i figured something in here could be wrong but as soon as i checkout and build before that commit it works again

1764890406
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
blackbeard420: you copied your Io interface, not allowed

1764890422
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
or rather, the interface can be copied, but the Io.Threaded instance cannot

1764890443
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
put Io.Threaded in your AoC struct, and then call a.threaded.io() to get an io

1764890474
blackbeard420!~blackbear@user/blackbeard420
ahhh i see, trying that now. odd that it worked prior to that change

1764890495
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
it's not odd - that change added more mutations on the Threaded struct

1764890551
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
basically, delete io from the struct and that will solve the problem. or, you can keep io on the struct, but you need to make Threaded not get copied (currently your io is pointing to dead memory)

1764890660
blackbeard420!~blackbear@user/blackbeard420
that worked, thanks!

1764890749
blackbeard420!~blackbear@user/blackbeard420
didnt really have a need to have the io in the struct anyways

just spitballing, I know language proposals are not accepted.. but what if `anytype` was replaced with an `any` block, that sort of works like `test{}`, but `@This()` evaluates to the concrete type

1764890817
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
`anytype` becomes just `any{}`, `anyerror` becomes `any { assert(@typeInfo(@This()) == .@"error"); }`, and you can define 'interfaces' however you want by just setting `const MyThing = any { assert(whatever); }`

1764890946
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
no boxing, exactly same behavior as anytype, fully monomorphized, just coupled to an assertion block I guess

1764891136
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
I guess @TypeOf(any{}) == anytype

1764891242
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
I guess it does nothing that moving that to the first line of the function doesn't already do

1764891278
rvrb!~rvrb@156.146.51.230
great thought experiment #zig good job

Affliction!affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction
Heh, read the proposal, thought "Yeah, that does kind of fit in with the pragmatic minimalism", then read that second last line, "Yeah, that'd fit even better"

it's basically the original interfaces thread on github in an 8 minute rubber duck
