I think the main problem is the medium (the terminal)

it would make perfect sense, for example, for the web ui (which already exists btw) to list all the unit tests that were run in an exapandable tree structure

almost all test frameworks I'm familiar with print out a summary by default that includes indication of succeeded tests

in general, test logs are intended for human or automated consumption and I think hiding information by default is an actively worse user experience

however, I've also not done anything to try to change the status quo so

After getting familiar with using unit tests in the library I'm writing, I need to apply that to my other tools.

andrewrk: (Fwiw, in the context of builds for packages and the suchlike, typically "verbose" is used as standard to preserve a full log output of the build for later use)

E.g. with cmake projects I'd use make VERBOSE=1

I just discovered --summary new, which I have been using a lot more. it has helped me track changes I am working on in a project with many steps

LAC-Tech, a little late but why not just add a `std.debug.print("1st test Foo started")` at the beginning and `std.debug.print("1st test Foo success"). I do that, and it keeps everything pretty obvious ^^

Earnestly: yes, --verbose-tests or something like this could be a nice option

--verbose currently means "print each child process CLI before running it"

does anyone know what the expected model is for handling signals safely using std.Io.(Evented|Threaded) ? is there a vtable op for these that's just not quite there yet? or is it intended to be more along the lines of "set up your own sigaction callback, and use to to feed an Io.Queue or set an Io.Event"?

bblack: I added "open question: what about signals?" to https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/issues/30150
