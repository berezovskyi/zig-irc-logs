is there a way to do something like `var os_window = if (use_x11) try allocator.create(x11.X11Context(*AppContext)) else try allocator.create(wl.WaylandContext(*AppContext));` e.g. at runtime select one of two different types?

1740619225
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
you could do `var os_window: *anyopaque = if (foo) ...` but then every time you want to actually do something to it you'd have to cast it back

1740619239
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
which is essentially how interfaces like std.mem.Allocator work

1740620075
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
ezzieyguywuf: what torque suggested would work, but I would use a tagged union instead of anyopaque

1740620175
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
but I get the sense you're trying to add an abstraction at the wrong layer

1740620563
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
grayhatter: can you elaborate on the mistake you think I'm making?

1740620605
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
"you'd have to cast it back" I think I only use it in one place so this isn't too terrible

1740620768
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
(er, I guess it's like 4 or 5 places but still)

1740620817
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I mean, you just described exactly why I said what I said

1740620858
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
I'm abstracting at the wrong layer b/c I only use it in 4 or 5 places?

1740620864
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
> "cast it back" is something you say when you're trying to fight the type system, instead of allowing it to help you. That's the mistake, maybe

1740620920
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
hm, yea fair, but I think the tradeoff is to instead compile different versions of my binary, one for X11 one for Wayland. I'm not married to the idea but I'd prefer to compile this into a single binary instead

1740620920
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
yeah, there are some places where the type system can't help you... but every time I've tried to fight it, I later decide that was stupid, and I go back and rewrite it without fighting it. 

1740621036
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
there's no reason you can't write `union (enum) { x11: *X11PointerThing, wayland: *WaylandPointerThing };` no casting, no fighting

1740621070
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
it's more or less equivalent to casting because you have to then check the active union field at every use point

1740621087
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
btw I found this error super helpful: "src/main.zig:161:27: error: value with comptime-only type 'type' depends on runtime control flow" 👏

1740621092
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
it's just embedded into the type instead of being a separate boolean

1740621128
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
right

1740621155
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
actually I think I'm already using a tagged union for such a thing somewhere

1740621164
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
and, you don't have to cast anything... that feels like a really important point

1740621244
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
ezzieyguywuf: the layer I was thinking, was, most/all of your code should probably call the Compositor api you write which will wrap x11 and wayland, and dispatch to either. Then you don't have to worry about casting, or checking everywhere, only when you write the api itself

1740621269
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
oh that's right, I'm doing that here https://github.com/ezzieyguywuf/zcad/blob/stash/src/VulkanRenderer.zig#L659-L663

1740621278
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
I suppose I could just use the same pattern in both spots

1740621445
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
grayhatter: yea I get your point, but rly it seems this just pushes the casting/switch-statements into this Compositor thing. there's no getting rid of them rly

1740621477
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
the approach I've been taking is "start simple then abstract", so I think leaving the casting/switch-statements in main is probably fine for now

1740621478
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
you probaly know your code better than I do

1740621509
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf

1740621777
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
ezzieyguywuf, why are you writing same project in different language ? 

1740622092
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
stealth_: I stopped the project in those other languages lol

1740622135
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
ezzieyguywuf, so you were just searching for the right language to write your software in, eh. 

1740622184
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
I mean, this is just a side project that I've had for far too long. and I've been using it to explore what I do/don't like about different languages

1740622240
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
ezzieyguywuf, makes sense. btw do you know of https://openscad.org/

1740622254
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
I've learned a lot - like honestly, at the end of the day the language doesn't matter too much, the core skills needed to code good don't really change. but there are many parts of different languages that end up making it so I do/don't want to code in them for large complex projects

1740622272
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
stealth_: very familiar with openscad, and opencascade as well

1740622341
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
I haven't looked at openscad in many years though, it may be worth checking out. I recently downloaded a newish version of freecad after stepping away for a long time (they finally got to v1.0!) and while it's still a very impressive piece of software my excursion reinforced for me the decision to (try to) roll my own

1740622430
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
ezzieyguywuf, openscad has done a lot of improvements, they are close to releasing new version but you can always download their nightly build should be up to date.

1740622480
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
i head somewhere freecad dev passed away or something? maybe thats why?

1740622506
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
ah but I remember now, I believe openscad is constructive solid geometry whereas I wanted a Boundary Representation modeler

1740622529
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
but yea openscad is pretty nice, I honestly should've just probably used it and ran with it, as much as I like programming

1740622544
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
but this brep project has kept me entertained for quite some time, so there's also that 😁

1740622591
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
ya nothing wrong with creating your own project, the learning part is important.

1740622633
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
they are even adding https://pythonscad.org/ into openscad project.

1740622658
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
stealth_: yikes that's sad. freecad leans heavily (entirely) on opencascade, and there's this "topological naming issue" that is extremely vexing, and their ultimate solution to that (if you google realthunder topological naming you'll find info) is just not something that I'm happy with. plus the codebase (at least back when I was in it) is _very_ OOP and layers and layers and abstraction.

1740622669
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
2012-me would've loved that, but 2025-me doesn't rly

all i know is i type code and it gives me a 3d module i can use in my 3d printer :p

1740622776
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
i was thinking of using blender for it but its hard to get precision right. you really need cad

1740622876
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
yea, I've never tried to use blender for smthn like that, but I do imagine it's hard to get right in there since it wasn't designed for that.

1740622926
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
yep, well its free. most good cad software are very expensive.

1740622935
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
blender is common for modeling artistic models for 3d printing, but some people also use it for engineering models

1740622948
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
there is (was?) some parametric modeling plugin for blender

1740622969
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
I've mostly used onshape recently though since I do not care overmuch about tools being open source

1740623032
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
there are few cad type plugin for blender, i just got convinced to use OpenScad. It was simple enough and saw the result right away so its alright. 

1740623062
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
I strongly dislike openscad because it only creates meshes, you don't get a parametric model out of it

1740623127
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
i see. 

1740623181
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
i think i saw another program that did openscad like code to module and you could also draw apparently! It might have been some saas project.

1740623379
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
zig is pretty nice, I hope it sticks around. I don't want to have to restart my project again lol

1740623409
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
ezzieyguywuf, it will take time since they are just hearing about it. They seem to have the gui they are using and debugging anything in C++ seems like hell. 

1740623530
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
I been pondering if i should learn C or Rust for the past 5years and i finally started learning Zig :) I wanted to learn high level language (Python) and 1 low level zig should do it. I don't want to learn any other language.

1740623584

it can only get better from here... if a language + software solves the problems ppl been having for ages, they will use it.

1740623734

Is there a working project that does wrapping zig to python? I found this "Ziggy" but looks like 0.12+ update killed it.

1740625871
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
ezzieyguywuf, trying out this freecad, it sure has come a long way. Its neat how openscad script works on it, though its very slow.

1740625924
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
openscad on the other hand runs too fast to control sometimes.

1740626119
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
yea freecad is a very solid piece of software

1740626168
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
does it run slow on your system? i have a brand new system and it seems really slow to me. 

1740626381
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
I honestly just opened it, checked if https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=222760#p222760 this bug still exists (it doesn't) then closed it

1740626386
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
but yea I guess it did seem kind of slow

1740626415
stealth_!~stealth_@216-197-160-97.regn.static.sasknet.sk.ca
they really need to improve that, slow = ppl wont use.

1740626468
ezzieyguywuf!~Unknown@user/ezzieyguywuf
I was working on freecad back in the v0.16ish days, it was pretty zippy then. I think the realthunder stuff probably slowed it down quite a bit, but I'm very much guessing

1740680039
tsmanner!~tsmanner@mkmvpn.amd.com
Does anyone here have an idea for how to hook up unpredictably named generated code to a zig build step?  I'm trying to wrap calls to an external tool that generates C++ sources in a zig build step.  I can control some aspects of the generated file names (a prefix, the output dir) but not the names.  Some of the names include a hash of some kind, and I can't disable that behavior, but I still need to build those generated sources.

1740680751
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
tsmanner: can you get the generated name somehow?

1740680820
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
huh, I don't understand why you need it, or what behavior you want from your build.zig so I don't have many ideas I can suggest

1740681118
k_hachig!~k_hachig@2605:b100:12d:f432:f83e:81a5:daa1:718e
tsmanner: you could write a directory crawler and add the sources to your build that way?

1740681293
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
yeah I was thinking what k_hachig suggested with std.fs.Dir.walk

1740682319
tsmanner!~tsmanner@mkmvpn.amd.com
I looked into it, the problem is that the files don't exist until the upstream step has run, so when the build itself is compiled, the files aren't actually known, only the directory they'll be in.

1740682386
tsmanner!~tsmanner@mkmvpn.amd.com
It's an open-source hardware simulation tool called verilator, that transpiles SystemVerilog code into C++, and some of the files include a hash that I don't know how to predict.  All I do _know_ is that I have to compile all the .cpp files in that predictable output directory.

1740682559
tsmanner!~tsmanner@mkmvpn.amd.com
Verilator has the ability to compile to a binary, but I have no clue what compiler it will be using to do that, I am hoping to get zig to do all the C++ compilation work, and have verilator do the transpile.  Some sort of hook between that step and the exe make function maybe? 

1740682650
tsmanner!~tsmanner@mkmvpn.amd.com
I also considered modifying the Compile.make function to, as a local hack for now, to detect a Generated LazyPath for the CSourceFile root directory and no subpath to mean "compile all the sources in that generated directory"

1740682769
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
tsmanner: I'm pretty much convinced that the build system already can do exactly what you'd want from it. But It's not really documented, and it's innards are somewhat complex so I have no idea how do it

1740682809
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I think/assume it already can, because you're basically describing parts of how it works

1740682886
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
if you figure out how to write a custom step, you can build a dependency chain that will call your custom function in the order it needs to be

1740682955
tsmanner!~tsmanner@mkmvpn.amd.com
Yeah I feel the same way!  I have been rooting around for a bit, but haven't found it.  It does _feel_ like there's a Right Place to do this

1740683007
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
what are you building in zig?

1740683021
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
i.e. what's the final output artifact of build.zig

1740683022
tsmanner!~tsmanner@mkmvpn.amd.com
grayhatter a custom step is a good idea too, I'm leaning toward hacking it into the c_source stuff locally just for a proof of concept, and if that works, invest in a custom "Verilator" step that does the right thing end-to-end, emitting a static library or so

1740683072
tsmanner!~tsmanner@mkmvpn.amd.com
An exe that simulates a RISC-V processor with some C++ test bench components to stimulate and verify it

1740683112
tsmanner!~tsmanner@mkmvpn.amd.com
Specifically from verilator, I at least need a library to link that has the compiled System Verilog of the logical design

1740683116
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
there's build.addSystemCommand() so `verilog = addSystemCommand();` and then `zig_exe.dependOn(verilog.Step);` (or something like that)

1740683169
tsmanner!~tsmanner@mkmvpn.amd.com
Yeah, that's what we've got right now, the output of that system command is a directory of files, that I don't know the names of

1740683176
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
there's a lot of useful sounding functions in here too https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.Build.Step.Run

1740683190
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
addOutputDirecotryArg

1740683203
tsmanner!~tsmanner@mkmvpn.amd.com
I can ask verilator to produce a library, but I have no clue what compiler it will invoke under the covers, probably some random system installed one

1740683295
tsmanner!~tsmanner@mkmvpn.amd.com
I've gotten as far as the directory being produced from a sv source file, and put into the .zig-cache/ dir.  The next build step uses `addCSourceFiles` to build the contents of that directory, but there are 4 files in there with names that include some random hash

1740683366
tsmanner!~tsmanner@mkmvpn.amd.com
Zig understands the dependence on that generated directory through the addCSourceFiles({.root = generated_dir, ...}), so we're SOOOO CLOSE!

1740683508
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.Build.LazyPath.addStepDependencies

1740683614
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
you just gotta create a step, and that step finds and then outputs a list the compiled files, and have that finder step, depend on the command that generates the files

1740683619
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I assume that'll work?

1740683770
tsmanner!~tsmanner@mkmvpn.amd.com
Yeah if that "finder" is basically a Compile step that gets it's files list at the start of the make() function instead of preconfigured in, I bet it would work
