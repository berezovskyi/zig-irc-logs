andrewrk: What do you mean by 'learn an new skill its fun' ? Don't understand how it was related to my problem/goal.

as a starting point maybe consider something like `pub fn wrap(comptime function: anytype, args: anytype) @typeInfo(@TypeOf(function)).@"fn".return_type.? {...}`

gastus: he means if you learn Zig comptime you can do what you want. if you don't want to dig into that right now, and just want an off the shelf thing, you could probably use something like https://github.com/chung-leong/zigft which does some cursed inline assembly to make an API to do this kind of thing

I asked gemini. It generated Python code using clang.cindex outputting the wrapper .c code.

They say great programming is built on the shoulders of giants. Not here. At #zig, we do all our programming from scratch. No hand holding. 😉

I believe I heard news a few months back about Zig no longer aiming for Plan9 support? Say it ain't so. :(

Am I overlooking something or is there no way to enforce a maximum line length for zig fmt? Where's my 80 col max crew?

1765253306
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
akiva: you're not overlooking anything. zig fmt intentionally has no configuration options, and also no opinion about line length

1765253322
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
you can influence it about where to put line breaks with trailing commas

1765253324
akiva!~Akiva@user/Akiva
… but I do! :)

1765253358
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
and a couple of other things. basically you can "negotiate" with zig fmt

1765253374

I had tried that but I think it was zls/zig.vim messing with me.

is there a simple way to ensure a hand maintained C header stays in sync with the actually exported from Zig C API?

It seems `std.Io.Threaded` has been deprecated. Looking through the docs for the changes but must be missing it…

1765313673
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
akiva: I don't think it's deprecated.  Maybe you're looking at stable release docs?

1765319239
akiva!~Akiva@user/Akiva
bblack: Sure thing. Running 0.15.2 and trying for a simply http server. main.zig: https://termbin.com/bxdg and error: https://termbin.com/uj7r

1765319400
clevor!sid649024@id-649024.hampstead.irccloud.com
std.Io.Threaded has been added after 0.15.2, so you'll want a nightly instead.
