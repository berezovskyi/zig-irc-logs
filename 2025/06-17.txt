Is there a good guide for improving the efficiency of zig programs? I'm trying to write a system info fetcher and I want to make sure I'm getting the system info pieces in the most efficient way possible

most of the same techniques for optimizing c programs can be used with zig, if you're familiar

Also, arena allocators are cool.

clevor: I saw some code using those to get environment variables; is that more efficient than a getenv syscall?

Hi! I'm running into this error, and I don't see an obvious way to interpret it? Both the struct and the member function only have one pointer level, so this error message doesn't make much sense. https://zigbin.io/08ed73

cancername_: I think it's saying you need to try easy.*.setopt()

1750162038
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
but may it means something more like easy.setopt.*()? I've never run into that pattern, so no idea.

1750162317
cancername_!~cancernam@user/cancername
bblack: thanks, it does want me to do easy.setopt.*(), but why? it's one level of pointer, *const fn(...), so it should work, no? I can't turn it into a function value either, since I'm not aware of a way to cast the function type directly and you can't dereference function pointers at comptime

1750162375
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
oh wait, I see it now

1750162381
cancername_!~cancernam@user/cancername
(or rather, it wants me to use the opaque type Easy, since it's not recognized as a member function\)

1750162385
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
pub const setopt:

1750162393
cancername_!~cancernam@user/cancername
yes?

1750162409
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
^ as the error says, it's not a field or method.  it's a pub decl of a funcptr.

1750162418
cancername_!~cancernam@user/cancername
it is a method, since it'

1750162425
cancername_!~cancernam@user/cancername
s declared as a decl

1750162436
cancername_!~cancernam@user/cancername
and it is one pointer level

1750162473
cancername_!~cancernam@user/cancername
and to call it as a member function would require a dereference, but that's not a thing at comptime, so what am I supposed to do here?

1750162500
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
so if you leave everything else alone, you'd have to call it as: Easy.setopt(easy, ...)

1750162508
cancername_!~cancernam@user/cancername
bblack: correct

1750162602
cancername_!~cancernam@user/cancername
bblack: what's the solution, then? I can't wrap it with a function since you can't pass your varargs on to another function (without inline asm), and I can't cast it since I can't dereference the function pointer

1750163028
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
yeah I'm not sure if it's more about the fn-pointer or about the opaque

1750163032
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
or both

1750163243
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
(does it have to be opaque?)

1750163284
cancername_!~cancernam@user/cancername
bblack: it seems like function pointers obtained from @extern are special-cased to support just this, so this works for my use case: https://zigbin.io/e9300f

1750163379
bblack!~bblack@wikimedia/bblack-WMF
oh wow, I wouldn't have guessed that.  is that what translate-c does for similar cases?

bblack: I don't know

grayhatter, from the research I've done  std.rand is supported to exist in the newer versions of zig.  If it's not there, I would like to know it. I'm using version 0.14.1.  If it is there, I would like to know what I'm doing wrong. I'm brand new testing zig.

how come the memory values from sysinfo and /proc/meminfo are different? I want to get the memory efficiently but im confused why the values are way different for the used ram: https://zigbin.io/7ab247

There is a really small thing I would like to change in the std. Is there a solution to do that without clonning the whole std ? (basicly std.json.stringify.WriteStream.write in .optional I want to output "{}" instead of "null" when struct and there is no overwrite function like for enum and other) 

1750203310
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
tonitch: it hard to understand exactly what you're asking, but if I understand correctly. No, there's no way to overwrite a single format thing like that. That answer aside, if the output should be {} it's not an optional. It's required, the default is just empty.
