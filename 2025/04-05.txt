anyone have good projects for me to get comfortable with allocators and memory stuff?

What do you want to make?

clevor!sid649024@id-649024.hampstead.irccloud.com
Just working on a small part of a larger project each day helps.

1743812781
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
yeah, pick something fun, you can learn allocators and memory stuff incidentally

1743812785
Cuboid!~Cuboidigo@user/Cuboidigon
ok

andrewrk: By the way, is the 2025 Zig roadmap video coming out soon? The 2024 roadmap video released in January 2024 and the 2023 one in April 2023, so I would assume the 2025 roadmap may get streamed soon.

At least on Zig SHOWTIME.

not scheduled yet but Loris asked me if I wanted to do one and I said sure

So with labeled switch, I have to continue the label with the next state, instead of saving it and continuing the switch on the saved state? IE (state: switch (self.state) {..})

1743814813
rockorager!~rockorage@172-234-192-125.ip.linodeusercontent.com
As opposed to state: switch(State.initial_value) {..}

1743814852
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
you specify the next state as the value to the continue expression

1743814869
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
`continue :state .value;`

1743814888
rockorager!~rockorage@172-234-192-125.ip.linodeusercontent.com
ok

1743814894
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
the contents of the `switch (initial_state)` are only used on the first iteration

1743814907
rockorager!~rockorage@172-234-192-125.ip.linodeusercontent.com
I have a use where I have to return out of this function and come back so I have to save it either way

1743814925
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
yeah, there's nothing stopping you from doing that, but it's not required

how would i read the contents of a file in zig

1743817364
Cuboid!~Cuboidigo@user/Cuboidigon
actually im just gonna fake that for now

would be nice if the doc comments on the top result there had a "see also" section

grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
lol, thanks for the suggestion then

1743829321
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
is there a way to specify multiple options? e.g. -Dpath=path_one -Dpath=path_two or should I use csv for this?

1743849814
lemons!~doggie@user/doggie-:49517
comptime @sqrt() ?

1743854480
bw!sid2730@user/betawaffle
Ok maybe this is a silly request, but it might be nice if the index part of ArrayHashMap was available as its own thing that could be used without the array. Bad idea?

1743854544
bw!sid2730@user/betawaffle
Like… what if I wanted to compose it with more than just the array in a single allocation

1743854586
bw!sid2730@user/betawaffle
Like if I wanted the MultiArrayList to have extra fields

1743862134
Cuboid!~Cuboidigo@user/Cuboidigon
hello, how would i unwrap a error union?

1743862228

Cuboid: const unwrapped = erroring_maybe catch {your handling here};

if you want to piss off ppl, you can catch unreachable;

1743862323
Cuboid!~Cuboidigo@user/Cuboidigon
ok

1743862328
Cuboid!~Cuboidigo@user/Cuboidigon
might do that then

1743862718

finished setting up random numbers, but they dont really look random, because they all always get the same fraction of the maximum number

1743862745
Cuboid!~Cuboidigo@user/Cuboidigon
nevermind

1743862755
Cuboid!~Cuboidigo@user/Cuboidigon
it decided to work right as i said that

1743862807
Cuboid!~Cuboidigo@user/Cuboidigon
it does occasionally get the max on all of them though

1743863522
Cuboid!~Cuboidigo@user/Cuboidigon

Has someone done GTK4 development in Zig already or what is the preferred Zig UI toolkit?

1743870486
janvhs!8d8fee6549@user/janvhs
Doing SwiftUI on macOS and want something in Zig for native Linux compared to doing Python+GTK

1743870671
rockorager!~rockorage@172-234-192-125.ip.linodeusercontent.com
janvhs: see the Ghostty project for a gtk4 app. Ghostty uses the C api directly

Is there an option to print a number if thousands separators (1,000,000)?

rockorager: thanks!

rockorager: it actually seems to use GObject introspection via a library I found previously. That’s even more perfect, because no macro shit and its adopted by a big project :D

1743875677
rockorager!~rockorage@172-234-192-125.ip.linodeusercontent.com
oh nice. been awhile since I’ve looked at the gtk code

1743876023
janvhs!8d8fee6549@user/janvhs
rockorager: That’s fair GTK is usually more a pain than a pleasure, but nice that I can write my frontend in Zig, too :D

I haven't seen that

1743888027

I don't really identify as a language creator, I generally find people who enjoy programming languages to be insufferable :P

you like some c++ bashing probably though ;)

flower_!~archie@83-81-123-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl
I think he is the 'inventor' of OOP, but C++ didn't get the idea according to him. It's interesting how he looks at is from the perspective of a biologist.

well, when I say "OOP" I mean pointer-based polymorphism

1743888764
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
i.e. you have multiple different kinds of things that share a common base struct, and you pass around pointers to that common base struct, which can then be dynamically casted to a pointer of the whole struct
