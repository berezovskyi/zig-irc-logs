mimivalsi, might be helpful to look at https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Choosing-an-Allocator if you haven't seen it

note that the Allocator struct itself is just two pointers (one to the vtable, one to any relevant state), so it's fine to copy that struct as long as what they point to remains valid

very strongly recommend against using page_allocator as a general purpose allocator, it will map an entirely new page for every new allocation
