 aged poorly

andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
the bird problem can now be done offline while the gis one requires additional hardware or network connectivity

I'll have to keep testing my code tmrw to see if I can get the loop to work properly

1757207181
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
I mean you could store relevant geolocation information offline and do an offline lookup as well

1757207306
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
though it does assume image data is GPS tagged

1757207447
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
but I generally agree it's pretty weak for an xkcd, since both problems were nontrivial to solve, it's just that one managed to get solved before the other

1757207980
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
I mean my thing is offline except for when it fetches images

1757207991
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
But I need to figure out the lazy load thingy

1757208012
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
Cause then that'll improve load times and everything

1757208035
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
Like my original code doesnt make all the bird boxes at once nor does it download all the images at once

1757208086
JetpackJackson!739e7f3d14@user/JetpackJackson
Idk how to write that in qt terms though

1757208910
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
torque: that's fair but I think the boundaries of national parks changes a lot faster than evolution :P

so in zig 0.15 and removal of usingnamespace ... is there no way to hoist declarations up to a module's index.zig without manually declaring them one by one?

1757213874
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
you're looking to `@import` a handful of things?

1757213927
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
quick question: have you eliminated redundancy in their namespaces as per https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.15.1/#Avoid-Redundant-Names-in-Fully-Qualified-Namespaces ?

dsal!sid13060@id-13060.lymington.irccloud.com
Is there a flag I can pass to `zig build test` to build the tests without running them? 

1757225615
squeek502!~squeek502@user/squeek502
dsal, instead of a step that depends on the result of `addRunArtifact`, have a step that depends on the result of `addInstallArtifact`

1757225684
dsal!sid13060@id-13060.lymington.irccloud.com
I tried some things like that and then eventually figured out the reason I wanted it.  It'd be cool if there were a random flag.

1757225704
dsal!sid13060@id-13060.lymington.irccloud.com
I was trying to make a project with a bunch of tests compile under 0.15 and had a mix of test and compile failures which were annoying to sort out.

1757225716
squeek502!~squeek502@user/squeek502
there is when using `zig test` directly: `--test-no-exec`

1757225780
squeek502!~squeek502@user/squeek502
but the separation of `addTest` and `addRunArtifact` basically does that for you

1757225815
dsal!sid13060@id-13060.lymington.irccloud.com
I at least got this going under 0.15.  My CI tells me it doesn't build against master, though. lol

1757225845
squeek502!~squeek502@user/squeek502
you could probably create an option that makes your `test` step switch between depending on `addRunArtifact` and `addInstallArtifact`

1757225865
squeek502!~squeek502@user/squeek502
so then you'd do `zig build test -Dno-exec` or w/e

1757226058
dsal!sid13060@id-13060.lymington.irccloud.com
Oh neat.  Yeah, this project has a particularly complicated build.zig

grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I'd argue that xkcd aged perfectly; and you're just under estimatating the engineering effort that was involved in putting a gps in every single personal cell phone

1757227048
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
you know... because the satellites had to exist

1757227252
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
(both problems require bootstrapping of a huge amount of engineering work, and as torque said it's only the order it was solved)

1757227344
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
grayhatter: i'm saying gps is the harder problem than identifying bird photo now

1757227441
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I think it's much more likely I'd figure out how to solve the GPS problem before I solved the photo content ID problem

1757227458
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
harder feels relative

1757227494
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
I'm thinking about solving it from scratch I mean

1757227496
wootehfoot!~wootehfoo@user/wootehfoot
gps feels more safety-critical, than uh, lapelling photos

1757227538
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
it's older tech that's more trusted

1757227569
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
in 20 years, when visual content ID is required to stop cars from crashing, it might change the balance 

1757227616
wootehfoot!~wootehfoo@user/wootehfoot
well, if it's in a car, then it obviously needs to be a safety-critical system aswell

1757227639
wootehfoot!~wootehfoo@user/wootehfoot
which means it needs to be 100% deterministing, reproducible, and not hallucinate, and self-correct when it's insane

1757227641
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
maybe I'm wrong... how much pretraining is required to get reliable content identification working?

1757227651
wootehfoot!~wootehfoo@user/wootehfoot
deterministic*

1757227813
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
wootehfoot: I think you're conflating different types of AI. I don't think 100% determinism is a meaningful attribute when talking about object identification. And I've never heard of hallucination when talking about non-generitive AI

1757227916
wootehfoot!~wootehfoo@user/wootehfoot
determinism is a requirement for safety criticality, in the sense that you can't have a JIT in there, and if you offload compute to an accelerator, the code that runs there has also been vetted for safety-criticality

1757228178
grayhatter!~grayhatte@user/grayhatter
hmmm.... I'm not sure I agree, but it's an interesting idea

1757228244
wootehfoot!~wootehfoo@user/wootehfoot
well, if you ASIL D certify your software, someone else will tell you, good luck :) 

1757229247
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
I hope gps isn't safety critical

1757229280
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
also the problem is underspecified because there's not reliability requirement

1757229305
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
I think GPS probably requires a lot broader knowledge domain than image classification tbh

1757229454
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
not only all the rocketry and orbital mechanics to put a fleet of satellites at half-geo but there's a shitload of other weird stuff you have to account for for the precise timekeeping including atomic clocks and relativistic effects

1757229525
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
I can't say for sure, but I think one person focusing on image classification from scratch for 40 years would probably make much further progress than one person focusing on bootstrapping a GPS system from scratch in the same time period

1757229563
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
but of course this begs the question of what technological basis the project is starting from

1757229705
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
gps has more dependencies. more special hardware than a CPU, and it requires satellites flying around cooperating

1757229717
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
you already depend on a CPU for everything, so that's "free"

1757229779
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
and then you're also depending on what constitutes a state park, which could change any random day

1757229793
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
but what birds look like takes many thousands of years to change

1757229921
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
I'm going to go around gluing fake limbs to birds to fool the bird detection system

1757240456
netvor!~netvor@2a00:ca8:a1f:cd0:dbfc:7ba9:de8d:e0d2
torque: it's good in that it mirrors the reality (at the time, at least).   i think it works even with your framing: we have 2 tech problems with different level of progress, the customer having no concept of how different the progress level is between them... (both are sufficiently advanced for a normal untrained human mind to feel like magic)

just curious, what does "short writes" mean in the context of Writer.splatBytes doc?   "Writes the same slice many times, allowing short writes."

1757245634
netvor!~netvor@2a00:ca8:a1f:cd0:dbfc:7ba9:de8d:e0d2
i mean is it specifically referring to some low level I/O architecure concept?  (or am i just reading into it too much?)

1757247018
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
netvor: it means that it may not write all the data you ask it to write in a single call, and will return a value indicating how much it actually wrote expecting you to call it again

1757247027
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
just like the write(2) syscall for example

1757247312
netvor!~netvor@2a00:ca8:a1f:cd0:dbfc:7ba9:de8d:e0d2
ah thanks, makes perfect sense.  good to know that term

https://zigbin.io/7c0599 im still having issues with the buttons not being deallocated/cleaned up when i close the program, but other than a loop idk how to make a bunch of buttons that will be properly cleaned up, cause if i make one button outside a loop it works fine but thats just one button

love Writer.Allocating;  so many places where i've used ArrayList just to get its .writer().any() and pass it somewher, now these are just nicer.   (moving to unmanaged variants made them a bit more verbose, now it's as small as managed but nicer)

1757280739

Oh that's neat.  I could've used something like that for reading.  Is there a thing that will copy from a Reader to a Writer until EOF?

1757289493
dsal!sid13060@id-13060.lymington.irccloud.com
I guess that's stream()
