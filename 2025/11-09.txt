are there any torrents i can use to download the zig compiler? Or any other method. Normal sites don't work for me at all…

phaleth!~phaleth@user/phaleth
wget -c https://ziglang.org/download/0.15.2/zig-x86_64-linux-0.15.2.tar.xz

sunflr: I do not have a solution to your problem but I am curious to learn more about it, is it network restrictions, connection quality, ..?

sunflr: do any of these work for you? https://gr.ht/zig/

rvrb: i'm in russia and apparently the government decided to block websites that rely on cloudflare. May have affected other sites too, no idea. Downloading from my package manager works at least but it doesn't have the latest zig version .-.

x3 i implied i may have a plan but i don't actually

Earnestly: what's dissident?

It's kind of mad how much stuff cloudflare controls

1762731445
sunflr!~sunflr@user/sunflr
google, amazon, cloudflare

1762731477
sunflr!~sunflr@user/sunflr
google works for me still surprisingly

1762731508
sunflr!~sunflr@user/sunflr
but yeah, companies basically control the web i think

1762731550
sunflr!~sunflr@user/sunflr
don't have to block all of the sites individually when you can just block one company

1762731594
sunflr!~sunflr@user/sunflr
that's why i asked if there's a torrent because those aren't tied to sites specifically

Afaik cloudflare is about 20% of web traffic

1762731629
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
As of 2022 > “Cloudflare is used by 80.6% of all the websites whose reverse proxy service we know. This is 19.7% of all websites”

1762731634
sunflr!~sunflr@user/sunflr
seems to be most of the web for me

1762731705
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
I haven't checked but I think most of the ordinary web we all experience is going to be cloudflare, normal websites, random blogs, etc. Google gets a large chunk of the pie because they just do so much stuff of their own

1762731723
sunflr!~sunflr@user/sunflr
yep

sunflr!~sunflr@user/sunflr
i like solving problems but this one's a bit too big ngl

1762731843
sunflr!~sunflr@user/sunflr
i could use a vpn but i don't wanna pay for any

1762731855

tor works but it's too slow

1762731877
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
Even if it is slow, it might be fast enough™ for a single download

Couldn't Russia just block all of the exit nodes?

1762731900
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
Although I wonder if there's some service that tunnels cloudflare through something else, hm

1762731913
Earnestly!~earnest@user/earnestly
Unless someone wants to give you an sftp url

sunflr!~sunflr@user/sunflr
Earnestly: i'll try sure. clevor: i'm using bridges to connect to tor
