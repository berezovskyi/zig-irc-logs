which is the better method for building cross platform libraries,

emekoi: I think the first.

Though what often ends up happening when I write that sort of code is trying to share methods

daurnimator
e.g. then may both have a .lock(delay). And I want to add a common method .lockNow()

1547254441
daurnimator
which results in: Mutex = struct { phandle: if (builtin.os == builtin.Os.windows) HANDLE else void, fd: if (builtin.os == builtin.Os.linux) i32 else void, fn lock(self: *@This(), delay: u32) { if (builtin.os == builtin.Os.windows) { ..... windows implementation ..... } else if (linux) { ...... linux imp ..... } } }

daurnimator, yeah that's what Mutex originally looked like

Tried sending a message to the mailing list, it bounced (twice).

Anyway, the message was about a suggestion: would a better name for orelse be ifnull ?

const tmp_buf = allocateTmpBuffer() ifnull return error.OutOfMemory;

gonzus, ifnull was considered:

andrewrk thanks for that link, and good to see there was already a discussion about this.

I would personally have gone with otherwise, but I guess it is too long. :-)

Also, let me take the chance to say that I really like what I have seen so far about zig, and I think you are doing an awesome job.
