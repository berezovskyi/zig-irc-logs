confirmed... that's why we have

emekankurumeh[m], fix pushed to master. thanks for the heads up

I've got a question regarding the `args: ...` syntax. I've been translating some of my project euler solutions I've done in other languages into Zig. Here is problem 5:

1550980476
strmpnk
My first pass made the mistake for making map on line 63 comptime. It runs but fails in this case as an empty slice.

1550980513
strmpnk
Is there a caveat to how this is evaluated during compilation? It seems that comptime would be redundant here.

1550980707
strmpnk
The other question was around conventions for local vars with initial values from the arguments like on line 42 + 43. I know the reason these are unassignable is for the pass-by-maybe-reference-or-value for non-integer types but it seems a bit awkward to me still (reminds me of my days writing lots of Erlang code actually).

1550985482
tgschultz
strmpnk, actually I think the reason it is unassignable is because arguments are always immutable. In the case of `fn(thing: *ThingStruct)` the pointer is immutable while the thing it points to is not.

1550985576
strmpnk
Yes, but the reasoning for the immutability is given in the docs.

1550985657
strmpnk
There are possibly other reasons I can imagine for this as well. constness is a good default in general.

1550985862
strmpnk
I'll have to dive into the compiler at some point to see how this is leveraged.

hello: has anyone built zig on Raspberry Pi 3B with RaspBian.  I tried to install version 0.3.0 from zig-0.3.0+98869edb.tar.xz. First unable to find llvm-config. I did sudo apt-get install llvm-dev.  New error expected LLVM 7.x but found 3.8.1

1551027074
Akuli
develonepi3, i had a similar problem on another debian fork

1551027085
Akuli
you need to install llvm 7 from their ppa

1551027112
Akuli


1551027253
andrewrk
develonepi3, why not use the binary build from

1551027283
andrewrk
oh, rpi is aarch64 isn't it?

1551027290
andrewrk
I should know :)

1551027853
andrewrk
develonepi3, just a heads up, linux-aarch64 is a "Tier 2" supported target, which you can read about here:

1551027872
andrewrk
(we want to get to tier 1 for that target but it will take some more effort to accomplish)

1551027921
develonepi3
RaspBian that I am running is 32 bit not 64 bit

1551028126
develonepi3
All I am wanting to run this on Ultibo bare metal which I believe is also 32 bit.

1551028323
andrewrk
develonepi3, if you have trouble building zig from source on raspbian, you can cross compile for your target

1551028694
develonepi3
andrewrk: Are most folks using Windows or Linux x86_64?

1551028708
andrewrk
develonepi3, yes I believe so

1551028749
scientes
develonepi3, true bare metal is quite well supported (as much as llvm supports it)

1551028772
scientes
although not as tested

1551028780
andrewrk
linux, windows, macos - x86_64 - these are the current Tier 1  (well tested, well supported) targets

1551028864
scientes
I did the initial arm64 porting work, but i just broke my arm64 laptop by dropping water on it

1551028881
scientes
so i am back on x86_64

1551028886
andrewrk
I did not know that happened, bummer

1551029559
develonepi3
andrewrk: When is tier 1 expected? I am also working on a FPGA doing lifting step for jpeg 2000 which I hope to merge with Ultibo.

1551029817
andrewrk
develonepi3, for arm32-linux ?

1551029900
andrewrk
that's hard to predict. I don't personally have any use for that target, and it's pretty low on my priority list compared to language stuff. So I think the timing of it will highly depend on contributions from others

1551029937
andrewrk
for tier 1 we would need Continuous Integration testing for the target and I'm not even aware of any services that provide testing for arm32 linux

1551030566
develonepi3
andrewrk, I have openjpeg working in Ultibo bare metal. I have 10 project that I just tftp a kernel7.img (RPi2) or kernel.img (RPi zero) and Pis reboot. I can download a bitstream to the FPGA and over 8 bit parallel port get the Gettyburg  address see

1551030733
andrewrk
develonepi3, neat!

1551030769
andrewrk
develonepi3, I'm also working on a rpi3 bare metal project:

1551030779
andrewrk
this one is aarch64. I cross compile to deploy

1551030823
develonepi3
andrewrk, The fpga work is using yosys tools all done on a RPi3B.

1551031011
develonepi3
andrewrk, Did you see

1551031144
develonepi3
andrewrk, He posted asking if anyone was interested.

1551032978
andrewrk
develonepi3, yes I saw that

1551032984
andrewrk
I actually thought you were markfirmware at first

1551034280
develonepi3
andrewrk, No Mark and I started working on Ultibo about the same time.  I use RaspBian and he is mostly Windows.

1551034463
develonepi3
andrewrk, I believe most is done in Ultibo less Wi-FI.  Networking, serial, spi, gpio, USB and VC4 appear to be working okay.

1551043426
develonepi3
andrewrk, If I get zig to build on ubuntu 16.04 will it zig then work on bare metal? I just got an executable zig on my ubuntu 16.04 system.

1551043478
andrewrk
develonepi3, you can use your zig on ubuntu 16.04 to create bare metal executables which you can then upload to your device and run

1551046973
develonepi3
ardrewrk, ./zig build-obj  -isystem ../../API/include/ultibo/ -isystem /usr/lib/arm-none-eabi --target-arch armv7 --target-os freestanding --target-environ gnueabihf ../../API/samples/zigtest/zigmain.zig I am getting an error Unable to find zig lib directory Any idea?

1551048848
andrewrk
develonepi3, looks like you built from source. did you remember to `make install` ?

1551048943
develonepi3
yes it installed in ~/testbuilds/ultibozig/zig-0.3.0+98869edb/build/bin & ~/testbuilds/ultibozig/zig-0.3.0+98869edb/build/lib

1551049079
andrewrk
I'm confused by this path name. are you just trying to have a working zig compiler? why not use the binary download?

1551049303
develonepi3
When I did the install in the build folder it created a bin & lib folders.

1551051139
develonepi3
andrewrk when you zig build xx.zig do you get a build.zip file? I tried several in the test folder and it just kept adding to build.zip

1551051177
develonepi3
ls

1551051386
develonepi3
I must have used zip instead of zig sorry
