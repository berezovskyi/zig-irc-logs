is freebsd CI broken or is it just me?

MajorLag, I think you need to merge master or rebase your PR to fix it

alright, not a big deal yet since fixing c_allocator didn't fix whatever is causing the failure in the other CIs, but that one had always passed so I was curious.

I'm interested in ziglang, am I in the right place?

Right, there's a big header saying it is lol

Szwagi: lol, yes you are in the right place. Welcome! :)

Soo.. I'm new to the language, trying to learn via writing some code and reading the documentation. What is the best approach to allocate a singular object on the heap via an allocator?

1546590862
Szwagi
From what I can tell, allocFn returns a []u8 and alloc returns []T. Came up with this -> var window = &(try allocator.alloc(Window, 1))[0];

1546590877
Szwagi
but it seems kinda hacky (?)

Szwagi: .createOne

(I actually use .create.... but I see that now has a deprecation notice. anyone know why?)

commit and PR seem pretty unrelated :(

Hi guys, I'm having trouble with the c interop again. I have a function that returns an optional pointer to a c struct, which I unwrap via orelse. If, however, I try to access any fields of that struct I get 'type [*]const T does not support field access'. Why is that? Does Zig fail to read the struct structure (no pun intended) in that case?

1546598965
daurnimator
forgot-password: you have an array there. you need to pick a member first

1546599039
forgot-password
Oh my god, how could I be that dense. I even have the c declaration right in front of me. Thank you, daurnimator :)

1546599295
forgot-password
Is there a way to automatically unwrap the first element of my optional pointer or do I

1546599391
daurnimator
forgot-password: huh? shouldn't it just be a case of adding [0] to your one-liner?

1546599464
forgot-password
Right, I can just put it in parens. Maybe I should get something to eat before I continue ^^

forgot-password: or edit the generated zig to change [*] to plain *

How would I go about converting a zig-string to a c-string? Is there anything to help me with that in the stdlib?

1546601361
kristate
Szwagi: is the zig string constant or runtime?

1546601380
Szwagi
would be nice if it was able to convert both

1546601457
kristate
Szwagi: if it's constant, you can simply use ++ like so: a_constant_str ++ []u8{0}

1546601480
kristate
Szwagi: and then ptrcast to c-string, @ptrCast([*]const u8, a_constant_str ++ []u8{0})

Managed to do something with only a few hours worth of experience with the language:

:D

1546605481

Szwagi: you may want `packed struct`

1546605805
Szwagi
thanks, fixed

1546606055
daurnimator
Szwagi: re line 134, you can do something like: `instance: if (builtin.os == builtin.Os.windows) HINSTANCE else void`

1546606199
daurnimator
Szwagi: your errdefer at line 209 seems pointless?

1546606250
Szwagi
it is, but i dont think the compiler will do anything with it anyway so it's there in case i put in some code there in the future

1546606434
daurnimator
Szwagi: btw, I don't recall if `extern struct` is prefered over `packed struct`

1546606484
daurnimator
Szwagi: otherwise, you should send a PR to zig to add those windows structs/defines you translated :)

1546606831
Szwagi
packed struct makes the program crash, so i'm guessing it's extern struct I need

1546607342
kristate
use `extern struct` for C ABI compatibility

1546607362
daurnimator
kristate: k. seems to not be documented.

1546607370
daurnimator
though I find it in generated source and the standard library

1546607378
daurnimator
wasn't sure if it was deprecated or new

1546607386
kristate
daurnimator: yes, it's on the TODO for 0.4.0
