i have an issue if anyone can help me through it

1551845029
darithorn
whenever i link libc i get an lld error saying it can't find "libgcc_s.so.1"

1551845093
darithorn
i did "zig libc" and looked through the directory that zig is looking at for "libgcc_s.so" and that file is there but for some reason lld is looking for "libgcc_s.so.1" which doesn't exist

darithorn, funny you should have this problem... it's very related to a big project I've taken on in the last 3 days

1551845326
andrewrk
going to bed but I should be able to push it tomorrow :)

1551845347
darithorn
okay. i was gonna say, i've never had this issue. i recently changed distros so i thought it might be because of that

1551845354
darithorn
i'll try again tomorrow then :)

howdy all

so i was able to fix the issues with my trampoline function. however I am not sure how to exactly approach passing arguments to the wrapped function as well as having it be adaptable for any fn type.

suirad
I'm thinking maybe varargs can work for me here, but i'll have to experiment with propagating the args to the lower fn.

is copy elision supposed to work when assigning to a derefâ€™d pointer?

1551877349
andrewrk
mikdusan, it will but not right now

1551878202
mikdusan
andrewrk: excellent

Akuli
is there a set type in std? i want to have something that's kinda like an ArrayList of pointers, but i don't want to use an ArrayList because i need to do lots of deletions given an element of the list

1551889033
andrewrk
Akuli, you can use hash map with `void` value type

1551889051
Akuli
nice

andrewrk: you around?

1551896924
andrewrk
hi WilhelmVonWeiner

1551896928
andrewrk
oops. hi wilsonk

1551896946
wilsonk
LOL... I am getting this error when building stage 2 on Ubuntu 16.04:  zig: /home/wilsonk/Downloads/llvm-7.0.1.src/lib/IR/Metadata.cpp:577: void llvm::MDNode::resolve(): Assertion `isUniqued() && "Expected this to be uniqued"' failed

1551897002
wilsonk
haven't seen that one before...strange

1551897004
andrewrk
hmm. well I recently did that in the llvm8 branch with llvm 8.0.0rc3 (assertions enabled), so it may already be fixed

1551897026
andrewrk
"did that" meaning building stage2

1551897073
wilsonk
sorry, I haven't seen that error before while building stage2

1551897109
wilsonk
oh, nvm I see what you meant

1551897111
andrewrk
I'll do another merge of master into llvm8 and run the tests there

1551897115
wilsonk
ok

1551897157
andrewrk
anyway I'll make sure we're assertion clean just before merging llvm8 into master, which is happening within a week or two (pending llvm release)

Akuli
how do i print the name of an union(enum) at runtime?

1551897341
andrewrk
Akuli, you mean which field is active?

1551897344
Akuli
yes

1551897349
andrewrk
@tagName()

1551897356
Akuli
nevermind @tagName works

1551897370
Akuli
i thought @ functions are for compile-time things, but now that i think about it there's no reason why that would be so

1551897384
andrewrk
they're just functions provided by the compiler

1551898692
Akuli
how do i cast usize to u32 so that it wraps around or does whatever instead of an error on overflow?

1551898713
Akuli
@intCast has ub on error

1551898913
daurnimator
Akuli: @truncate

1551898960
Akuli
nice, should have looked at the @ function list more carefully

1551899066
andrewrk
Akuli, this list might also be helpful:

1551912986
darithorn
andrewrk any progress on the big project?

1551913160
andrewrk
yep

1551913276
darithorn
great, i'm assuming you were talking about the first class support for C compiling
