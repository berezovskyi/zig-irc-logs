unfortunately not

Am I allowed to post code snippets?

1573776172
adamkowalski
or is that frowned upon

1573776677
dimenus
nope that's fine, use pastebin / bpaste / etc

1573776827

i'll just leave this here:

real hardware test of today :)

1573777366
mq32
and with this: gn8 (or good morning, daurnimator) :D

1573777462
adamkowalski
dimenus okay I created an empty zig project with zig init exe

1573777472
adamkowalski
I'll paste my code and show you what I'm doing

1573777787

1573777793
adamkowalski
thats my build file

1573777819
adamkowalski


1573777824
adamkowalski
thats my src/main.zig

1573777834
adamkowalski
i've even hard coded the paths

1573778284
adamkowalski
Hmm I tried with glfw as well with no luck

1573778284
adamkowalski
exe.addIncludeDir("/usr/local/Cellar/glfw/3.3/include/");

1573778285
adamkowalski
exe.linkSystemLibrary("c");

1573778285
adamkowalski
exe.linkSystemLibrary("/usr/local/Cellar/glfw/3.3/lib/libglfw.3.3.dylib");

@adamkowalski I know you're not here now, but in case you check out the logs later, try this for SDL 2 on macOS:

1573822271
bgiannan
euantor, curious why you need the addIncludeDir/addFrameworkDir ? Here's my build.zig

1573822330
euantor
bgiannan: Did you install sdl2 via homebrew? The only way I could get it to work when installed via homebrew was by being explicit

1573822343
euantor
(using zig 0.5.0, haven't tried master)

1573825034
frmdstryr
Can zig be used with Qt/Gtk?  If so are there any example repo's anywhere?

1573825054
mq32
oof.

1573825070
mq32
I don't think Qt is "nice" to use, as it's a full-featured C++ API

1573825085
mq32
Gtk may be possible if you can port the headers

1573825095
mq32
but afaik GObject uses a pretty complicated macro system

1573828980
bgiannan
euantor, yes installed via homebrew

1573829091
euantor
Oh, weird. On my system it just threw errors about being unable to find SDL without it

1573829188
bgiannan
weird because brew ln everything so zig searches for SDL in /usr/local/include and finds the ln-ed SDL2 directory

1573829537
euantor
I should probably try it again, just in case. I did originally try without it and it failed though

1573831775
adamkowalski
Is there a way to change the color of the `std.debug.warn` output?

1573832181
frmdstryr
You can make your own function that adds a ansi color prefix and suffix

Hi folks.  If I am trying to use `zig build` to build C source files that target Windows, how do I ensure that the build and link step are passed the correct parameters, so I don't run into any missing windows symbols or headers?

1573839727
AlexMax
I've tried to addIncludeDir/addLibPath/linkSystemLibraryName my way to a successful compile, but my build.zig is turning into a morass and I can't help but think there might be an easier way.

1573841983
shakesoda
AlexMax: linkSystemLibrary should work, but make sure you use a build from master

1573842046
shakesoda
the detection for missing pkg-config was broken until just recently

1573845781
dimenus
AlexMax: can you paste your build.zig?

1573849151
ForLoveOfCats
Figured I might as well ask. Is there any way to achieve something like distinct types in Zig? (beside just wrapping it in a struct)

1573849184
ForLoveOfCats
(and yes I saw the proposal, I'm just curious if there is any way to achieve something like it "right now")

hi, I got an error message that I noticed people had talked about in the logs, but I wasn't sure if it got fixed? (It's due to a bug on my part, but it should be fixed so you get a better error message :)  )

1573849749
Srekel
"The following command exited with error code 3221225477:"

1573849769
Srekel
was mentioned here:

1573849844
Srekel
in my case, it happens if I do this:

1573849858
Srekel
for (self.component_set.toSparseSlice()) |ent, dense| {

1573849880
Srekel
...but toSparseSlice has void return type instead of slice:

1573849881
Srekel
pub fn toSparseSlice(self: Self) void {

1573855579
Srekel
I just posted a new library (package?) here:

Neat

AlexMax
shakesoda, dimenus|home sorry, i was at work and was only doing zig on my lunch hour

1573856371
AlexMax
now that I've had an opportunity to look at it, I found out that I wasn't linking against libC

1573856470
dimenus|home
ah, good stuff

1573856479
AlexMax
That allowed me to compile the C files, but when it came time to link, I'm now running into missing symbols like __imp__SHDeleteKeyA and __imp__SendMessageA

1573856688
AlexMax
I think that first one is located in shlwapi but I then get an error saying that it can't find libshlwapi.a when I try and link against it

1573856808
AlexMax
I mean, I do know where those libraries are on my linux system, they're in my system's mingw directory.  But I thought zig was suppsoed to bring in mingw for me.

1573856822
AlexMax
it clearly brought in the include files

1573856851
AlexMax
and libc, I'm not getting any errors about missing C stdlib functions

1573856870
shakesoda
it should be able to find those with linkSystemLibrary("shlwapi")

1573856895
AlexMax
that's exactly what I have, and yet when I `zig build` I get lld: error: could not open 'libshlwapi.a': No such file or directory

1573856896
shakesoda
(it does on my windows system, at least)

1573856904
AlexMax
I'm on Linux, if it helps.

1573856954
shakesoda
hm, I haven't tried to do any linking windows stuff in cross builds

1573856990
AlexMax
I think I can just add my system's mingw directory to get it working, but I thought zig was supposed to bring in stuff automatically.

1573857025
AlexMax
I know that as soon as I added the thing about libC that my next compile took a long time as it presumably was builiding the environment necessary to build windows apps

1573857041
AlexMax
so I would've throught the proper libraries would've come along for the ride.
