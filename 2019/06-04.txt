1559606780
scientes
so has it been decided that varargs are to be removed?

1559606791
scientes
cause i just found out they are buggy

1559606812
daurnimator
they shouldn't be; they're a required part of C interop

1559606821
scientes
oh yes

1559606826
scientes
actually that works

1559606834
scientes
its just that you can't use fastcc with var args

1559606840
scientes


1559606842
daurnimator
yeah I saw your issue.

1559606981
scientes
now i gotta figure out how to print a float without var args....

1559610212
scientes
can i call sizeOf from the compiler?

1559610226
scientes
oh of course i can

1559610232
scientes
i just have to insert it into llvm first...

1559610867
tgschultz
it is weird that the compiler can't infer my error set, but can verify that an explicit error set is correct...

1559625097
emekankurumeh[m]
imo error sets are nice in theory, but they are quite broken in implementation

1559633327
daurnimator
huh. writing python just then I started wishing for zig-style error handling

1559635309
marijnfs_
whats brokeen about it

1559641747
mq32
heyhoh :)

1559641812
mq32
is it possible to create a link-time-optimization-objectfile with zig?

1559641835
mq32
i would like to integrate some zig code in my C++-Project, but i don't want to lose LTO optimization for the zig code

1559642111
mq32
example:

1559644909
SamTebbs33
Can you create an object file with Zig the link it with your C++ objects with LTO enabled?

1559644916
SamTebbs33
then link*

1559644996
SamTebbs33
LTO is done at link time so it's managed by the LLVM linker under-the-hood (AFAIK)

1559646147
mq32
SamTebbs33, i somehow have to pass "-flto" to the code generator

1559646158
mq32
LTO object files are not the same format as non-LTO object files

1559651674
SamTebbs33
Then I'm not sure, one of the more experienced zig contributors will have to help you there

1559652106
SamTebbs33
You may be able to do it by supplying a different build mode:

1559652726
mq32
nah, the build mode should be the same (featurewise) for LTO and non-lto

1559652758
mq32
maybe andrewrk knows more?

1559656172
BitPuffin
anyone know why when a C library calls vprintf the program segfaults?

1559656175
BitPuffin
I linked libc

1559656188
BitPuffin
maybe stdout isn't open or something?

1559656344
SamTebbs33
Are you giving the library bad input?

1559656391
BitPuffin
it doesn't seem like it no

1559656441
BitPuffin
it's raylib

1559656479
BitPuffin
so I'm doing raylib.InitWindow(1280, 720, c"hello");

1559656763
BitPuffin
hmm well it segfaults even when I try to use printf

1559656851
BitPuffin


1559656941
SamTebbs33
Hmm, see if you can reproduce it without raylib, if not then perhaps it could be an issue with how Zig links with libc or raylib

1559657177
BitPuffin
hmm it works without

1559657513
BitPuffin
hmm so c printf works, but if I actually call raylibs init function, then also printf stops working

1559658296
SamTebbs33
I'm gonna guess it's an issue with raylib then

1559658624
BitPuffin
yeah or at least the combination of zig and raylib

1559658635
BitPuffin
since it probably works in C

1559659562
SamTebbs33
How are you linking raylib with your zig code?

1559659937
BitPuffin
just exe.linkSystemLibrary("raylib"); in the build.zig

1559660311
BitPuffin
hmm maybe I'm not linking to all the dependencies

1559660705
BitPuffin
didn't seem to change anything

1559663068
BitPuffin
Hmm so looking at how raylib calls the vprintf

1559663074
BitPuffin
It doesn't seem to do anything particularly spooky

1559663088
BitPuffin


1559663184
BitPuffin
But a possible workaround I see is to disable support for tracelog

1559663940
BitPuffin
Are there any known issues with calling c libraries that use va_list or something?

1559664048
andrewrk
BitPuffin, zig doesn't (yet? ever?) have any compiler warnings/errors for C printf - they would have to be hard coded

1559664067
andrewrk
you'll want to carefully double check that your % and your args agree with each other

1559664081
SamTebbs33
There was a discussion in a GitHub ticket about c libraries and va_list, I'll see if I can dig it out

1559664089
SamTebbs33
I can't guarantee it will have anything of value though

1559664112
andrewrk
does a debugger give any clues? valgrind?

1559664191
FireFox317
Hey guys, if I want to add code to a PR that is already merged should I add a new PR or can I reuse the merged PR somehow?

1559664205
andrewrk
FireFox317, new PR

1559664207
FireFox317
I already created the new PR btw

1559664220
FireFox317
Okay thankyou!

1559664269
andrewrk
I'll have a look in a couple hours. I'm going to be a bit quiet on the issue tracker for a while as I focus on

1559664501
FireFox317
andrewrk: I would like to work a bit on the compiler, is there any particular issue that I can focus on or should I just pick on in the contributer list?

1559664520
SamTebbs33
Look out for issues labeled with "contributor friendly"

1559664522
FireFox317
'contributer friendly' list*

1559664533
SamTebbs33
^

1559664535
andrewrk
FireFox317,  you saw this doc, yeah?

1559664595
FireFox317
SamTebbs33: Yes, that's why I mean :)

1559664596
BitPuffin
andrewrk: but this isn't me calling printf with unmatching args. This is me calling a C library that happens to log things with vprintf

1559664624
BitPuffin
So an external system library is being grumpy when called from zig

1559664663
FireFox317
andrewrk: Yes, I did actually, thanks for reminding me!

1559664703
BitPuffin
SamTebbs33: hmm you mean the one linked in the manual?

1559664796
BitPuffin
Anyway gdb didn't really give me anything helpful as far as I can decipher

1559664801
BitPuffin
Haven't tried valgrind

1559665306
andrewrk
BitPuffin,  it looks like you don't have debug symbols for the code where the crash is happening. that's going to be tricky to solve

1559665356
BitPuffin
I compiled the library from source

1559665377
BitPuffin
So unless the build system is very annoying I can hopefully rebuild with debug symbols!

1559665401
andrewrk
debug symbols are on by default if you built the C code with zig

1559665425
BitPuffin
I was also considering just throwing it into the zig repo

1559665435
BitPuffin
So might as well go ahead and do that

1559665448
BitPuffin
But I'm not really sure how to use Zig build all that well

1559665459
andrewrk
that makes sense since it's not documented and unstable

1559665523
andrewrk
BitPuffin, that's libc the crash is in btw

1559665537
BitPuffin
Yes

1559665542
BitPuffin
From vprintf no?

1559665547
BitPuffin
The internal

1559665585
andrewrk
what OS / libc is this?

1559665602
BitPuffin
Latest Ubuntu

1559665603
andrewrk
glibc? I wonder if

1559665610
BitPuffin
Some glibc

1559665643
BitPuffin
It certainly could be :)

1559665967
FireFox317_
Uhm, could someone with some git/github knowledge help me out? Somehow I ended up referencing some issues (i.e. #2046 and #514). I'm not sure if everybody sees this or if it is just me, but I would like to fix it somehow. `timonkruiper` is my github name. Should I just delete my fork and re-fork it, (still have a waiting PR tho), so that maybe doesn't work. Any help is appreciated

1559666067
andrewrk
FireFox317_, what's the problem?

1559666154
FireFox317_
Well, if you look at those issues mentioned, it shows that I reference them in my own fork (at the bottom of the issue). Maybe I only see this, then there is no problem, but it shouldn't be there.

1559666225
andrewrk
FireFox317_, don't sweat it, it's just a little bit of noise that people will have no problem ignoring. you can edit your github comments

1559666554
FireFox317_
andrewrk: Hmm okay. I somehow rebased my own copy and it added my name to some commits. I think that is why it is showing up as a reference in the main repo

1559666620
andrewrk
are you talking about #2621?

1559666626
BitPuffin
Hmm is there a repo somewhere with example of compiling C sources with zig

1559666660
andrewrk
BitPuffin,

1559666695
BitPuffin
Nice

1559666706
BitPuffin
Is there a way to do some globbing

1559666712
SamTebbs33


1559666730
andrewrk
BitPuffin, you'd have to implement it yourself, but glob support is planned for the zig build system

1559666748
BitPuffin
Alright

1559666753
andrewrk
BitPuffin, you can also try -target x86_64-linux-musl and see if that solves the problem

1559666765
andrewrk
that would be a good clue

1559666777
BitPuffin
For now it's something that a little bit of keyboard macroing can't solve

1559666791
BitPuffin
Not can't solve

1559666851
BitPuffin
andrewrk: how is that done with build

1559666888
andrewrk
your_artifact.setTarget(.x86_64, .linux, .musl);

1559666967
FireFox317_
andrewrk: Well, it happened when I added that PR yes. But just to be clear, at the bottom of #2046 do you see the reference to my fork? Because that is a mistake from me

1559667078
mrkishi
we do. whenever you reference an issue in a commit message anywhere on github, it'll create a mention on the issue.

1559667137
andrewrk
FireFox317_, yes I see it. don't sweat it

1559667531
BitPuffin
hmm

1559667534
BitPuffin
how do I define C symbol

1559667569
donpdonp
has anyone done a writeup on building an osx .App/ from zig? especially tips like what to link to in the build.zig and what support files are needed in the .App/ folder

1559667680
BitPuffin
ahh I guess I can just pass it to the addCSourceFile derp

1559667733
andrewrk
BitPuffin, oh you meant -D args? yeah

1559667742
BitPuffin
yup

1559667779
andrewrk
alright I'm gonna go quiet now, need to focus on my core lang changes. will be on later

1559668971
BitPuffin
Hmm okay so I am now building raylib in zig

1559668985
BitPuffin
and now it works. Hooray....?

1559669071
BitPuffin
if it is the glibc thing you mentioned, then I guess it makes sense if it works now that I build it with zig, cuz it's gonna link to the same one

1559669377
FireFox317_
I got rid of the references by deleting my fork and re-forking it :) Apparantly there were so called 'dangling' commits in my fork.

1559671092
BitPuffin
arrk, how do I add a file so that it can be imported directly without relative path in the build system

1559671095
BitPuffin
not command line

1559671184
BitPuffin
tried using linkLibrary but norp

1559671281
BitPuffin
addPackagePath maybe

1559672454
DesDeux
Hello, maybe someone can help, i've trying to import raylib headers with "const c = @cImport(@cInclude("raylib.h"));", but get "error: declaration shadows primitive type 'bool'  pub const bool = extern enum {" . Tried solving this with including stdbool.h "@cInclude("stdbool.h");", wich results in ldd errors "lld: error: undefined symbol: ..." where ... is functions wich i've tried to call from raylib.h.

1559675404
SamTebbs33
I have a nooby question: I have a function that takes a pointer to a struct, makes a pointer to a field within that struct, then attempts to change the fields in that pointer:

1559675438
SamTebbs33
But if I step through those lines in the function within GDB, the fields in the entry struct never change, what am I doing wrong?

1559676711
SamTebbs33
I also tried assigning by dereferencing the pointer first but had no luck `(entry.*).four_megabyte_pages = true;`

1559677160
mikdusan1
you might try a code reduction because i assure you, assigning to pointer.field works :)

1559677314
SamTebbs33
Yeah I imagined that it should work >.<

1559677433
SamTebbs33
I allocated the main struct with allocator.alignedAlloc, if that makes a difference :p :D

1559678190
SamTebbs33
Is that the correct way of getting a pointer to directory.entries[page] though?

1559678204
SamTebbs33
var entry: *DirectoryEntry = &dir.entries[page];

1559679262
emekankurumeh[m]
i think `++` should work on all strings at comptime

1559679284
emekankurumeh[m]
but that might lead to abuse though

1559679291
halosghost
… what would ++ even do on a string?

1559679316
halosghost
increment a pointer?

1559679336
emekankurumeh[m]
what do you mean?

1559679350
halosghost
are you talking about C-style pre/postfix ++ operator?

1559679381
emekankurumeh[m]
`++` in zig is array concatenation

1559679433
emekankurumeh[m]
there are no increment operators in zig other than `+=`

1559679443
halosghost
ahhhh

1559679446
halosghost
I misunderstood

1559679448
halosghost
fair enough

1559687056
wilsonk
mq32: did you figure out how to get LTO working with C++ and a zig object?

1559687198
wilsonk
if not, then you can do it by outputting all the code as LLVM bitcode and then use LTO across the entire link (at least that is the way I have done it in the past with a different LLVM-based language and clang++ bitcode)

1559689464
emekankurumeh[m]
hmm, i thought zig already did lto

1559692523

I assume the web files thing is due to this one:

mrkishi
can't find how you're uploading the tars though
