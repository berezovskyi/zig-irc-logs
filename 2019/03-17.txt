Is there an easy/elegant way to make a (comptime) loop over all the possible enum values of a specific enum type?

Barabas: I'm not used to comptime things but this works:

Cool, thanks!

Barabas: as you can see there is some redundancy between @typeinfo and other @ functions, later you'll probably use std.meta which just uses @typeInfo:

1552832539
gamester
will just use* - std.meta does not exist yet, I think

1552832602
gamester
or at least I think it's not finished

Barabas
ok

the fields.value is a bit weird, as I expected it to return ... oh well maybe it makes sense. At first I thought it would be of the enum type, but it's a usize.

1552832675
Barabas
or sorry, comptime_int

1552832822

you can get the tag type like this: @typeInfo(your_enum).Enum.tag_type

also take a look at std.meta, it seems there's good stuff in there

How do you make a field of a (tagged) union active?

1552835472
Barabas
I tried doing

1552835494
Barabas
my_union.Field = undefined;

1552835515
Barabas
but there it complains that it accesses an inactive field :(

1552835519

I think you have to reinitialize the whole thing

1552835537
hio
my_union = union { .Field = 3 }

Hm... ok, yes that seems to work.

gamester, fixed:

my new favourite error:  return error.WIP;

mikdusan, nice- I'm also a fan of @panic("TODO")

mikdusan: I prefer NYI

WIP suggests you'll actually come back to it later ;)

1552863263
daurnimator
though @panic("NYI") is probably better: it doesn't mess up error signatures...... though maybe that's a good thing: if a function has NYI in it's error set you know it isn't ready to use yet....

though I more often deal with scenarios where I'm *not allowed to throw*, so the @panic is preferable
