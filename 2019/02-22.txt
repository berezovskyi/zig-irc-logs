so what's the difference between zig and similar languages like rust?

wow handy

andrewrk: interesting language! BTW maybe add https:// in front of ziglang.org in your topic line, to trigger the open link feature in most IRC clients

I should probably look into the wiki more, but now that I am here, how does Zig compare to Rust in terms of safety. I guess Zig targets lower level use cases, and so safety is harder to guarantee?

ottidmes, zig does not have rust's `unsafe` concept and it does not have a borrow checker. however in some ways zig can be safer than rust:

zig relies heavily on using debug builds to detect undefined behavior:

and then when you're ready to release, you have some release options:

some kinds of undefined behavior zig is not able to detect, even at runtime. I plan on creating an exhaustive list of these:

I'll be back in an hour or so

seems like a good choice, focus on correctness during development, and focus on performance for releases

I really like the zig fmt and parse error notifications when I save in vim, but I'm utterly confused as to how it's happening?

1550802403
gamester
I see now, it's coming from andrew's zig.vim project which I haven't updated in forever (iirc)

1550807572
andrewrk
gamester, I believe what happened is that it was using `zig fmt` which was erroring out, but as of a recent version of zig, `zig fmt` works in stage1

andrewrk: typo "sytsem" in docs

1550843506
andrewrk
gamester, fixed. also I fixed the issue you reported with @bitCast

new binary download should be available within 2 hours

gamester
awesome

I fixed all the known bugs having to do with packed structs (except an issue volatile)

1550843680
andrewrk
now I'll get those docs going

Is Zig inline assembly format the same as GCC inline assembly format?

1550852139
andrewrk
yes

1550852153
diltsman
At least that makes it easy to find documentation.

I will have to look at the ways to implement memcpy on ARM.  __aeabi_memcpy, __aeabi_memcpy4, aeabi_memcpy8.

they are essentially the same, just with extra alignment
