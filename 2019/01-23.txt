daurnimator: hard to say, but things are moving swiftly along now. I fixed a few issues found by the std lib tests today and ran into a tricky one

right now I'm getting confused by how to get --output-h to export a struct

Different question: is there a nicer way to write

daurnimator: You haven't exported the struct, it might also need to be declared extern. I'm guessing here, havning never done anything with output-h.

the only "cleaner" thing I can think to do with your other question is to make it one line, but that will make it worse if there's more than one err to check: `if(x) |_| break else |err| if(err != error.OutOfMemory) break;`

though, you could do this:

and that would still be very readable with multiple errors.

it occurs to me that this code is part of a loop, in which case there may be a better way using while(curr) |val| {} else |err| {}

MajorLag: it is part of a loop; but it's a do-while.... so in zig it's a while(true) { ...... if (x) { break; } }
