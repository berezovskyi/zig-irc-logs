I just had a really productive 2-hour phone conversation with thejoshwolfe. I feel good about how to proceed regarding async/await on blocking functions and cancel and stuff

1565741396
fengb
Is thejoshwolfe secretly the real designer behind everything?

1565741753
andrewrk
yes

1565741768
andrewrk
I just press all the keyboard buttons

1565741864
fengb
Iâ€™ve never seen the two of you in the same room ðŸ¤”

andrewrk: when does @field get expanded?

1565757324
andrewrk
it gets expanded into zig ir, and evaluated in exactly the same way as any other field access

1565757400
daurnimator
I've always found it weird how builtins aren't functions unless they are

1565757605
daurnimator
Did you mean to delete BRANCH_TODO in

1565758105
hspak
Has anyone seen this challenge? Might be fun to submit a Zig implementation:

1565759344
daurnimator
hspak: we already use lemire's algorithm in std/rand.zig

1565764388
mipri
Lemire's C doesn't look at all like the code referenced in std/rand.zig. that's linking a blog post that says it's inspired by Lemire.

1565764487
mipri
erm. actually it is similar. Just hard to see through the support for variable bit widths.

mq32
hey

1565773157
mq32
wrapping a c pointer is `[*c]i32`, right?

1565773542
samtebbs
Yeah that's a c pointer to an i32. Not sure what you mean by "wrapping" though

1565773579
mq32
wrapping "translating C to Zig"

1565774020
mq32
is it better to do constants as comptime_int or with a certain time?

1565785037
fengb
Certain time?

1565785501
mq32
*type

1565785502
mq32
sorry

1565785541
fengb
Yeah keep it comptime unless thereâ€™s a specific need

1565785791
mq32
okay :)

1565785816
mq32


1565785822
mq32
auto-generating zig code... :D

1565785921
samtebbs
Oh you made ZigPaint! I saw that on reddit yesterday

1565785926
samtebbs
Still need to try it out

1565785967
mq32
samtebbs: nope, that will be another ZigPaint then :D

1565785980
mq32
my project is not even startable or something

1565785991
mq32
it just prints out: "yeah, i've loaded glBindTexture with this address!"

1565786005
fengb
You need a more original project name :P

1565786013
mq32
hah, maybe

1565786044
fengb
Iâ€™m the king of stupid names

1565786066
mq32
so name my project! :D

1565786078
samtebbs
Ah this what I saw:

1565786111
samtebbs
Unless your pseudonym is tuket, I don't think it's yours

1565786170
mq32
nope, definitly not :D

1565786183
huuskes
his code switches indentation styles

1565786285
mq32
btw, zig provides a beautiful way to load OpenGL functions :)

1565786300
mq32


1565786321
mq32
"please import all function prototypes of this struct type from this library"

1565786451
fengb
comptime code generation?

1565786477
mq32
kinda

1565786509
mq32
i use comptime to iterate over the struct fields, refactor the name from "foo" to "glFoo" and load that function from the OpenGL library

1565786661
samtebbs
mq32: :O

1565786670
samtebbs
I need that for SDL2 and libz80

1565786670
mq32
i find this solution rather elegant <3

1565786691
samtebbs
I'm so tired of doing `z80.Z80_FOO()`

1565786699
mq32
the cool thing is that i can now give the user the OpenGL version he wants

1565786706
mq32
and only provide symbols defined for this OpenGL version :)

1565786766
mq32
> <samtebbs> I'm so tired of doing `z80.Z80_FOO()`

1565786775
mq32
me too, so i thought: comptime the problem away

1565786898
mq32
and samtebbs: on the name ZigPaint: What would you call the attempt to recreate the classic windows xp paint in Zig? :D

1565787875
samtebbs
mq32: Hmm, well ZigPaint sounds good. And I don't think the thing I linked is actually called that

1565787884
samtebbs
I just got the two mixed up :)

1565787896
samtebbs
There's paint.net isn't there? So maybe paint.zig :p

1565787903
mq32
hehe

1565790073
fengb
I hate endianness over the wire :(

1565790524
scientes
where there any changes to the parser recently?

1565790744
scientes
ahh, nvm

1565792378
samtebbs
mq32: How about ZigZag, and you can only paint with zigzags?

1565792438
mipri
future video: "now in order to make this stroke you'll need a subpixel zigzag--otherwise known as a line"

1565792581
mq32
<3

1565792594
mq32
you can only draw in the shape of the Spaceship "ZIG"

1565794291
influx6
I would like to task if anyone has implemented a http server in zig, one maintained and still functional?

1565794323
influx6
Am not sure what the progress of the language is, i was hoping to learn it instead of using rust, but not sure if its still being heavily worked on.

1565794485
samtebbs
influx6: http and networking are blocked on async functions

1565794498
samtebbs
andrewrk is making good progress though :)

1565794507
samtebbs
His latest youtube video shows it

1565794549
samtebbs
The language is being heavily worked on, certainly

1565794583
fengb
I think with the removal of cancellation, async is almost done

1565794790
samtebbs
mipri, mq32: Great ideas :D

1565794800
influx6
Oh awesome. Thanks for the info

1565794860
fengb


1565794946
andrewrk
there's still a lot to do but I'm planning on merging into master today because the tests are green. progress can continue on master branch

1565794956
andrewrk
(along with more PR merges, bug fixes, etc)

1565794978
influx6
Sweet!

1565795092
komu
influx6:

1565795225
influx6
komu Yes i saw it, but seems it was also pending on the async work.

1565800473
dimenus
i apologize for the dumb question, but how do i get the max value of an integer type?

1565800657
dimenus
scratch that, it's a userspace function

1565802989
donpdonp
var data = struct { list: std.ArrayList(Thing) }; data.list.append(thing); expected type '*std.array_list...' found '*const std.array_list

1565803006
donpdonp
im not sure how to get around that.

1565803045
donpdonp
oh sorry that'd be var data = Data.init(allocator) but you get the idea.

1565803560
donpdonp
oh the struct's fn had (self: *const Self) instead of (self: *Self)

1565804361
Tetralux
That kind of error is one of those that should tell you quite plainly why it's const.

1565804787
Tetralux
mq32: I had no idea you could do that with comptime.

1565804801
Tetralux
I'm guessing you cannot set whether a fn is inlined or not though xD

1565813955
andersfr
There's an alpha version of my Zig LSP implementation on github now:

1565821059
Tetralux
How do you add a new file to the stdlib?

1565821083
Tetralux
I'm having some trouble figuring out how one might add an extra file that contains tests to the stdlib

1565821090
Tetralux
Or does it just autofind them all?

1565821233
fengb
You'll need to add it to

1565821261
Tetralux
You mean like "_ = @import("my_file.zig")" ?

1565821272
Tetralux
I just found that part of std.zig and tried that.

1565821276
Tetralux
No difference.

1565821298
Tetralux
`zig build test-std -Dtest-filter=my.filter`
