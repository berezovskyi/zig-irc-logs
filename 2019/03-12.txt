andrewrk: should have just cherry picked the commit :P

1552355713
andrewrk
daurnimator, ah, I didn't realize you separated it out

1552355727
andrewrk
at at least now we have a reference in the commit history

Hi!

gunnarahlberg
is this the best documentation ?

1552386337
gamester
gunnarahlberg: That looks like a good introduction. There's also

1552386589
gunnarahlberg
gamester: thank you! I'll dig through some code and make myself some code examples

1552392946
gamester
When you call "setOutputDir" and set it to a directory that does not exist then zig build gives an unhelpful error message: "unable to write object file build/foo/bar.o: No such file or directory"

1552392969
gamester
though I had no trouble figuring out what was wrong

1552403650
gamester
andrewrk: Partly broken stack traces?

1552403685
andrewrk
looks like a potential problem in std/debug.zig dwarf info handling

1552403814
gamester
andrewrk: When I try to check out an old versions of zig I get "Unable to create builtin.zig: invalid format" when running zig build-exe

1552403851
gamester
removing zig-cache isn't enough, unless there's more than one

1552403883
andrewrk
gamester, yeah, that's because until 3a6f19de4 an unexpected cache format would error rather than treat it as a cache miss

1552403924
andrewrk
now if the format changes again it'll just keep working

1552403978
andrewrk
you can work around it like this: rm -rf ~/.local/share/zig/stage1/

1552413225
schme245
can you check the currently active tag of a union without a switch?

1552413339
andrewrk
schme245,

1552413348
andrewrk
(this documentation section is fresh as of a couple days ago)

thanks andrewrk!

gamester
Does builder.option create a comptime variable of sorts? How do I make use of these options in comptime code?

1552420440
andrewrk
gamester, it's not well stabilized yet but you can do this:

1552420476
andrewrk
that use case is an important one but it's in the middle of a sort of transition

1552420607
Sahnvour
hi, andrewrk I'm debugging the windows c_abi issue, which also has debug info issues

1552420623
Sahnvour
do you remember what's

1552420668
andrewrk
Sahnvour, I don't remember. sorry for not commenting it. I was probably looking at llvm source code to find out to do that

1552420702
Sahnvour
fair enough, did that too

1552420705
Sahnvour
I'll look it up

1552420877
schme245
does union -> enum implicit casts work for inferred unions as well?

1552421353
andrewrk
yes if you implicit cast to the @TagType of the union

1552421490
Sahnvour
can confirm LLVM pads to align to u32

1552421518
schme245
hmm... I can't get that to work, let me try with a reduced example

1552421721
schme245
am I doing this right?

1552422070
andrewrk
schme245, note that your `Tag` variable is not a type, it's an enum value

1552422092
andrewrk
you can do this: const is_branch = node == Node.Branch;

1552422133
Akuli
var a: [][2]u8 = {{1,2},{3,4},{5,6}};

1552422137
Akuli
how do i do this so that it works?

1552422161
schme245
man I could have sworn that was the first thing I tried, thanks again!

1552422201
Akuli
nevermind figured it out

1552422206
Akuli
var a: [3][2]u8 = [3][2]u8{[]u8{1,2},[]u8{3,4},[]u8{5,6}};

1552422226
andrewrk
Akuli, there are a couple open issues related to this

1552422608
Sahnvour
fixed :) the alignment was incorrect

1552423593
andrewrk
Sahnvour, wonderful

1552423775
schme245
man, I'm enjoying Zig so much, thanks Andy and everyone who's contributed :)

1552423785
andrewrk
glad to hear that schme245 :)

1552423878
Sahnvour
what's 0.4 planned release date ?

1552423984
andrewrk
currently April 08, 2019 but that's based on a prediction of llvm 8.0.0 release date. official release date will be announced day of llvm 8 release

1552424032
companion_cube
are you depending on llvm 8 features?

1552424059
andrewrk
no

1552424067
andrewrk
just keeping up to date

1552424078
Sahnvour
ok, and do you have a list of features/fixes you really want to go in before that ?

1552424086
andrewrk
actually, I just remembered - yes llvm 8 is the first one that has webassembly as a default target

1552424114
andrewrk
the 0.4.0 milestone is accurate:

1552424133
Sahnvour
thanks

1552424159
andrewrk
as we near the release date, some stuff will inevitably be post-poned

1552424191
andrewrk
until 1.0.0, however, zig will be released based on a schedule. after 1.0.0 zig will be released based on there being no bugs

1552427024
Sahnvour
it's getting late, see you
