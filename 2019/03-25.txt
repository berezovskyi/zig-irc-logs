Sup friendos. Long time no chat! I'm just getting back into zig after a long break and trying to build dbandstra/oxid and andrewrk/tetris, but I'm getting compile errors for both projects, using both 0.3.0 and master. Anyone have a sec to help me troubleshoot?

Here's the output of `zig build play` on tetris using master:

1553503840
gamester
hryx: I just built tetris successfully on master. Make sure your tetris source code is up to date.

1553504132
gamester
(on master)

1553504140
gamester
Oh I said that already, awkward.

1553524579
hryx
@gamester shoot, I double-checked -- I have latest master zig and master tetris, but sadly same results. still `error: cast discards const qualifier` in png.zig

1553524595
hryx
awkward indeed .___. what could be wrong

1553524600
andrewrk
a different png.h

1553524631
hryx
@andrewrk I'm not sure I understand?

1553524651
andrewrk
if the png.h is different on your system it could cause this

1553524673
hryx
ah, I have installed libpng via Aptitude so that is possible

1553524746
andrewrk
this is another example of a motivation for zig package manager

1553524756
hryx
I'm on Xenial BTW. Any tips or corrections are welcome

1553524802
hryx
andrewrk: what's the official ticket tracking a package manager feature, for my reference?

1553524818
andrewrk
hryx,

1553524846
hryx
wonderful, thankz

1553524850
andrewrk
what libpng version is that?

1553524860
andrewrk
I'm pretty sure that parameter is supposed to be a const pointer

1553524888
hryx
Let me check real quick

1553525063
hryx
/usr/include/libpng/png.h is 1.2.54

1553525079
hryx
I'm not sure that's the correct file being referenced

1553525227
andrewrk
I'm using libpng-apng-1.6.35

1553525286
hryx
I'll try to find that in the package manager

1553525321
andrewrk
I'm working to make this problem go away completely

1553525330
andrewrk
but it'll take at least another release cycle

1553525339
hryx
what exactly is the problem?

1553525393
andrewrk
the tetris app depends on system libpng, causing situations like this where we spend effort troubleshooting something that should Just Work

1553525427
andrewrk


1553525516
andrewrk
also, Windows

1553525520
hryx
Huh, interesting. My trouble here is I don't understand the difference between "system headers" and what I installed via the package mananger

1553525546
hryx
No worries if it's too much to 'splain here on IRC

1553525616
andrewrk
your system package manager installs system headers

1553525629
andrewrk
I'm using "system" to mean "that which exists outside of your zig installation"

1553525679
andrewrk
system stuff is the stuff that is different if you go sit down at someone else's computer with the same zig version

1553525797
hryx
Ok, that makes sense. In case it clarifies, my "system" is Linux Mint, apt, and I'm using snap for zig binaries (though I have also successfully built from master/version tags)

1553525887
hryx
I will read the ticket you linked to get a better context around this issue

1553526529
andrewrk
hryx, in summary, until zig package manager is done, you'll have to install a compatible libpng to make the tetris app work

1553526821
hryx
I'll see if I can install the same verion you mentioned (libpng-apng-1.6.35). to be hoped the same version works for dbandstra/oxid

1553527693

another way to make this problem go away is to write a png library in zig ;)

1553527731
andrewrk
yep

1553531730
companion_cube
well, lots of people praising or quoting Zig there:

1553531833
andrewrk
I hope zig community members are being nice :)

1553531860
companion_cube
seems so

1553531892
companion_cube
I'd say that Zig is gaining ground in people's minds as "the most promising C replacement", or something like that

1553531904
companion_cube
(the post is about rust not being a good C replacement, which I kind of agree with)

vegecode
Hello can someone tell me the best way to get the type with the minimum width that can represent a number? Generic functions that need to do shifting need an integer type with the correct width.

1553536923
vegecode
ie. u32 -> max shifts == 31 -> I need a u5

1553537101
vegecode
The best I can come up with is @IntType(false, T.bit_count - @clz(T.bit_count - 1))

1553537154
vegecode
The best I can come up with is @IntType(false, T.bit_count - @clz(T(T.bit_count) - 1))

1553537173
vegecode
I guess it needs a cast? I'm just wondering if there is an easy way since this seems like a common operation.

1553537666
vegecode
const S = @IntType(false, T.bit_count - @clz(@IntType(false, T.bit_count)(T.bit_count) - 1));

1553538664
andrewrk
vegecode, you probably want std.math.Log2Int

1553538714
andrewrk
std.math.Log2Int(u32) == u5

1553540114
desperek
hi, how can i for example get docs for fileio?

1553540122
desperek
do i have to use the source code?

1553540383
andrewrk
desperek, yes, until

1553540438
desperek
oh i see

I should really get around to updating and rewriting my zig implementation of png, then you wouldn't need to rely on libpng.

1553548823
andrewrk
inflate/deflate in the standard library would be a good start

1553552549
tgschultz
InflateStream is on my to-do list.

1553555398
daurnimator
I sort of disagree

1553555417
daurnimator
We should be able to rely on common C libraries like libpng without troubles

1553555441
daurnimator
If something as common as libpng causes issues... we're boned when it comes to rarer things
