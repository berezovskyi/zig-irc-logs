forgot-password: you seem to not be online right now, but to answer your question I believe that @compileLog will always be considered as an error, and rightly so, Zig looks to produce perfect code, and code with a Log in in

in it is not perfect code

kristate: Thanks for your answer, just saw it in the irc log. I agree with you, compiler output that is littered with warnings is annoying.

Is there a way to inspect the generated comptime code? I'm yet again having trouble to wrap my head around some code

mh, is it unsound to assign a variable to the return type from

like `var a = StackFallbackAllocator(1000); var b = a;`

For a function that takes a vararg how can I manage to fill an array with those values passed? I keep getting 'unable to evaluate constant expression' errors. Using 0.3.0 here.

what is your goal for using inline for

that is, what are your trying to accomplish?

I'm attempting to iterate through the fields of the Uniforms struct and find the type for the field I want to set.

1548028577
forgot-password
Basically, I want p.setUniform("uProjection", math.vec2(0, 0)) to throw a compile-time error, because it expects a math.Mat3 and not a math.Vec2

1548028633
kristate
hmm, wouldn't it be better to use a union?

Could you elaborate? I don't think I understand
