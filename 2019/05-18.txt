andrewrk: I didn't consider libc when exporting symbols in wasm so export will target both wasm and libc. It's pretty bad to include libc and it just pulls in all the implemented functions even if they're not used. Is there a more elegant solution?

i have a macOS host that builds zig from source, tests pass (except for a lld issue), a linux ubuntu VM (VirtualBox) that builds zig from source. tests pass.

i'm interested in getting a windows VM setup to achieve building zig from source.

1558181217
mikdusan
so i have windows 10 VM installed, account created. openssh activated. powershell set as default when ssh'ing in.

1558181350
mikdusan
so my first question is, should my tools like git, cmake, tar, be windows proper (terminology?) or cygwin based. if at all possible would like to

1558181395
mikdusan
continue similar iterative cycle - git, vim, cmake, run tests. via ssh.

1558181405
mikdusan
any suggestions or pointers would be welcome

git for windows is pretty good, it should have everything you need

1558181441
Sahnvour
also you might want to look at the scoop package manager, or chocolatey

1558181470
mikdusan
i've heard of chocolately before. do you recommend one over other?

1558181574
Sahnvour
I've gone with scoop recently that does not require to be run through powershell with admin rights

1558181591
Sahnvour
but it has less packages

so quick question

1558219968
Xe
is it expected that webassembly output fails on the latest nightly build?

1558219992
Xe
/Users/cadey/Prefix/zig/lib/zig/std/special/bootstrap.zig:113:33: error: root source file has no member called 'main'

1558220007
Xe
and if i try to define a main

1558220008
Xe
/Users/cadey/Prefix/zig/lib/zig/std/special/bootstrap.zig:113:33: error: 'main' is private

1558220321
Xe
oh, i found this:

1558220328
Xe
i need to use build-lib for now, gotcha

Is there a way to mark a test as pending/skipped on current architecture?

1558220781
daurnimator
oh, finally found it I think. return error.SkipZigTest

1558221344
Xe
is there a way to ignore return values?

1558221356
daurnimator
also, :( the bswap => byteswap breaking change makes it really hard to work on master using 0.4.0

1558221362
daurnimator
Xe: assign to _

1558221383
daurnimator
Xe: _ is a magic variable that always exists. anything assigned to it is thrown away.

1558221402
Xe
okay, how do i defer a function that has a return value?

1558221437
daurnimator
Xe: defer takes a block

1558221442
daurnimator
Xe: defer { _ = foo(); }

1558221606
Xe
i'm getting "cannot return from defer expression"

1558221771
daurnimator
Xe:
