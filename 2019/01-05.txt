andrewrk: misc idea re: createOne: call it `new`?

1546652606
daurnimator
otherwise, why is the memcpy compulsory? shouldn't the optimizer eliminate it?

1546652895
andrewrk
daurnimator, `new` is a good idea.

1546652920
andrewrk
there's an important distinction between "guaranteed by the zig language" and "the optimizer will probably eliminate it"

1546653020
daurnimator
given that we control the zig language; and the parameters to the optimizer; can't we make that guarantee?

1546653085
andrewrk
I'd be interested in an explanation of how that would work

1546653150

daurnimator: zig doesnt control exactly what LLVM does

1546653153
j`ey
/ can do

1546653209
daurnimator
yeah I don't know. but it theorectically seems under our control

1546653248

andrewrk: so I was quite confused about the .create deprecation. It wasn't communicated anywhere; and I think still used all over the standard library

1546653272
daurnimator
andrewrk: that it was in a seemingly unrelated commit+PR is.... opaque

I think I'm having trouble with understanding the comptime concept. Would somebody mind checking out this little gist? I tried to break it down as much as I can, so I hope it's understandable what I am trying to do :)

Here's the link:

knebulae
can you post a link to the c header?

1546691898
forgot-password
knebulae: I justed used that as an example, in my actual code it's importing the OpenGL header

1546692296

If call std.debug.warn instead of the c function it says that it cannot call var args functions during compile time.

1546692371
forgot-password
Does the fact that my function takes a comptime type result in the whole function being a comptime function?

1546701414
forgot-password
I tried a few other approaches, and it seems like as soon as I have a member of type 'type' in my struct the compiler throws the same error at me when I try to call the c function in any member function (is that what it is called?) of the struct.

1546701430
forgot-password
I assume that this is inteded behaviour, but I just can't wrap my head around it :/

forgot-password: i changed your gist a little,

1546711811
andrewrk
forgot-password, I believe what's happening here is that your struct, MyResultType, has a field of type `type` (the `input` field).

1546711839
andrewrk
the type `type` can only be used at compile-time, which means that your getResultType function will always be called at compile time

1546711852
andrewrk
you cannot call C functions at compile time

1546711860
andrewrk
hence the error

1546711908
forgot-password
andrewrk: Thanks, first of all. I don't intend to call the c function at compile time, I think this is where my misunderstanding is coming from. It's an OpenGL function, which makes it require a bound context.

1546711914
andrewrk
it is planned for compile error notes to explain this better

1546711964
andrewrk
consider that if you add a field of type `type` to a struct, then that struct must always have a compile-time known value

1546712737
forgot-password
ofelas: Thank you, but I don't need a value of type T. Instead I wanted to preserve the type for later use. However, it makes sense that the whole struct then has to be a comptime value, since type information is not available at runtime (Is that correct?)

1546712898
ofelas
that is my understanding

1546712980
forgot-password
Regarding my question about types at runtime or the former statement?

1546713155
andrewrk
correct: type information is not available at runtime

1546713209
ofelas
thanks, was reading about comptime...

Speaking of questions, I kind of feel like a small burden on this IRC, since I'm constantly spamming questions. But on SO there's only a single question tagged with zig. Are there any other available resources except for langref.html and the GitHub issue tracker?

1546713325
andrewrk
forgot-password, no, it's a very young language, still changing quickly, documentation is hard to come by

1546713346
andrewrk
newbie questions are 100% on topic here, don't feel bad

1546713359
forgot-password
Alright, great :)

1546713376
andrewrk
one more place you can look is at example code

1546713446
andrewrk
here are some github repos that have zig code

I also wanted to mention that's it is an awesome expierence so far and it's the most fun I've had programming in a long time. The only thing better than that was the revelation of Haskell ;)

1546713655

It's really rewarding to check out some upcoming languages from time to time

glad to hear that :)

I'm calling a function that only takes comptime arguments and try to store its result in another comptime variable.

1546721765
forgot-password
But the compiler complains that I cannot store a runtime value in a comptime variable. How do I make that function execute at compiletime?

1546722402
andrewrk
forgot-password, you can use a comptime expression

1546722428
forgot-password
Heh, just as you wrote that I prefixed my call with 'comptime'

1546722431

1546722459

That's where I got from ^^

1546722485
andrewrk
:)

1546724152
forgot-password
Is there some way to concat two '[]const u8's? The compiler says 'unable to evaluate constant expression', but @typeOf gives me the same type for both variables.

1546725553
ofelas
are you using ++?

1546725750
forgot-password
Yes

1546725801
forgot-password
However, one side should be a comptime value and the other a function argument. Is that not reflected in a values type? I guess that could be it

1546725817
ofelas
const s = "H"; const ss = "W!"; var sss = s ++ ss; they must be known at comptime

1546725879
forgot-password
Oh alright, do I have to do a dynamic allocation and write the two buffers into that?

1546726034
ofelas
i guess so

1546726105
forgot-password
Yep, that worked. Thank you :)

1546731137
andrewrk
forgot-password, you might find std.fmt.allocPrint useful

1546731476
forgot-password
Nice, that saved some lines, although the mem.copy wasn't too bad either :)

1546732752
forgot-password
Is there an std function to append a []u8 {0} to a string?

1546732799
daurnimator
forgot-password: you can use a c string literal
