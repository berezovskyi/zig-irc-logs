Hey guys, I'm currently trying to step through a Zig program with lldb

And I want to inspect the data of an Array, but it only shows me its pointer and len (which is how it's documented, so everything fine there). However, I don't know how to access its contents, does anybody have an idea how to do that?

This probably isn't spefici to Zig, but I couldn't find anything on google.

If I have a struct that contains a type, the whole thing will be completely gone at runtime. Is that correct? Or is it somehow possible to carry some information into runtime?
