my most frequent brain fart is: quick proto of a function. compiler reminds me it can’t infer error union error type when there’s nothing giving an error. so I my brain thinks “i want an error or a return type” so i literally type out words in my head “anyerror or void” → `anyerror|void` . and that’s not legal.. `|` is not `!` (pipe vs bang) .

But also, I might prep the packaging processes if we're not far away...
