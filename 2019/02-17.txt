andrewrk: should zig prefer to link to the static version of a library?

emekankurumeh[m], in what context? I think in zig build scripts, it should be explicit

in link.cpp

at least on mingw where there are .a and .dll.a files which should zig prefer to link to?

How can I set the outputpath in a build.zig script? I tried 'exe.setOutputPath("./bin");' without success.

does the bin directory exist?

Yes. It is a subdirectory next to the build.zig file

Amsel, hm you should be getting an error "cannot create ./bin: file already exists" or something like that

setOutputPath is the full path

andrewrk, it works now :) Is it normal that I get 3 files (exe, lib, pdb)? I did not expect to get a *.lib
