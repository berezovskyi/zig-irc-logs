anyone online using mac?

1567038894
Snektron
I ran into an issue where File.stat is causing an integer overflow  because of the limited precision of timespec on arm, yet i noticed darwin's timespec values are defined in c_long - 32 bit

1567038901
Snektron
so i think the problem should occur there too

1567039182
torque
iirc apple hfs+ timestamps are measured in seconds

1567039230
Snektron
shouldn't matter, tv_sec is multiplied by ns_per_s which causes an overflow if tv_sec > 2

1567039246
torque
ah

1567039292
Snektron
In any case, the fix i applied should also fix it for darwin

1567041274
Tetralux
Can someone else confirm this

1567041286
Tetralux
Make an ArrayList,

1567041307
Tetralux
ArrayList(?usize)

1567041336
Tetralux
Add an entry to it that is non-null.

1567041342
Tetralux
Does this panic: var idx = list.popOrNull() orelse @panic("");

1567041366
Tetralux
(Basically, I have a suspicion that orelse unwraps twice.

1567059005
alexander92
hm guys, how to install zig easily: both downloading a binary and building from source seem to require installed llvm

1567059035
alexander92
which i seem to have(llvm-8)

1567059042
alexander92
but not sure how to hint it to zig

1567059317
bgiannan
alexander92, under linux i just had to download the binary, i don't have llvm

1567059923
alexander92
strange: i do ti

1567059925
alexander92
it

1567059933
alexander92
and i try to zig build examples/cat/main.zig

1567059946
alexander92
(an example from the repo): and i get an error in searching for llvm

1567060752
gonz_
alexander92: While I don't think it's the important part of what's going wrong, `zig build` should be used with a `build.zig` file and if you want a binary to be created from a single source file, you use `zig build-exe`.

1567060834
alexander92
ah thanks

1567060955
bgiannan
alexander92, are you sure your zig commands points to the downloaded binary and not some other one?

1567068613
Snektron
alexander92: try ldd zig to see what llvm libraries you are missing

1567069904
bgiannan
does that notation actually works? `var more_points = [_]Point{makePoint(3)} ** 10;`

1567069924
bgiannan
i'm doing the same thing and zig is complaining it only got 1 item

1567069947
samtebbs
That should work as long as `makePoint(3)` is comptime known

1567069957
samtebbs
What's the error?

1567070014
bgiannan
ah it must be it my makePoint equivalent has an allocator as parameter

1567070065
bgiannan
how do i initialize my array then?

1567070086
samtebbs
What do you want each item to be?

1567070117
bgiannan
struct with one member needing to be allocated

1567070150
samtebbs
Do you have the source handy?

1567070169
samtebbs
If it absolutely requires an allocator then I'm not sure if you can do it at comptime

1567070200
bgiannan
i did not want to use an ArrayList because i know at comptime the size of the array

1567070353
bgiannan
actually it works

1567070359
bgiannan
my syntax was off

1567070361
bgiannan
still is

1567070368
bgiannan
it's 2d array:

1567070376
bgiannan
var grid: [][]const Self.Cell = [_][height]Self.Cell{

1567070378
bgiannan
[_]Self.Cell{Self.defaultCell(allocator)} ** height

1567070380
bgiannan
} ** width;

1567070394
bgiannan
error: expected type '[][]const src.level.Cell', found '[80][48]src.level.Cell'

1567070438
bgiannan
but if i do [width][height]Self.Cell.... i get `found [1][48]src.level.Cell`

1567070502
samtebbs
Set the type to `[width][height]const Self.Cell`

1567070511
bgiannan
got it

1567070513
samtebbs
The const may need changing too but try that first

1567070523
bgiannan
how can i convert that 2d array to a 2d slice?

1567070545
samtebbs
`grid[0..]`

1567070572
bgiannan
expected type '[][]const src.level.Cell', found '[][48]src.level.Cell'

1567070592
bgiannan
the second dimension needs also 0.. notation i guess

1567070637
samtebbs
Oh of course the 2d-ness means you can't do `[0..]`...

1567070715
samtebbs
Someone with more experience of slices will have to help

1567071016
bgiannan
ok i managed to do it

1567071029
bgiannan
the first dimension is an array, the second a slice

1567071048
bgiannan
then i just have the first dimension to convert to a slice

1567071118
mq32
brainfart: is anyone here open for real multi-dimensional arrays (with support for multi-dim slices)?

1567071142
bgiannan
after what i had to write just to initialize a 2d slice, yes

1567071150
mq32
so something like "var chessField : [8,8]?Piece;"

1567071172
mq32
"var topLeft : [,]?Piece = chessField[0..4,0..4]";

1567071536
Snektron
bgiannan: grid[0..][0..]

1567071557
bgiannan
Snektron, that doesn't work

1567071564
Snektron
it doesn't?

1567071571
mq32
Snektron, that does select the first row

1567071585
Snektron
oh wait, i see what you mean

1567071595
mq32
ah no, it's a syntax error

1567071598
Snektron
well its pretty logically that you cant do that actually

1567071636
Snektron
you'll first need to create an array of slices and then take a slice to that

1567071659
Snektron
alternatively you could store everything in a single array and manually calculate. Thats what i usually do

1567071685
Snektron
You could pretty easily create a KD array and KD slice

1567071696
mq32
Snektron, afaik that's the only possible way to do in most languages

1567071916
rivten
hey everyone ! i've got a very quick question : does any know how I can build a DLL on windows in 32-bit ? not 64. Basically, the only arch I can find in builtin is x86_64 which, I think, is 64-bit DLL...

1567071938
mq32
afaik the win-i386 target is broken

1567071953
rivten
yeah I tried i386 but got LLVM complaining at me :(

1567072013
rivten
Well, too bad for me :p  I guess I'll try to find the issue on github and follow it. Thanks for the quick response though ;)

1567072175
mq32
hm

1567072176
mq32


1567072185
mq32
seems to work though

1567072354
mq32
hm

1567072355
mq32
nope

1567072428
rivten
on my side I get a "error: unknow token in expression" from LLVM (and this points to a ])

1567072536
mq32
yeah it looks like it doesn't understand hex notation

1567072579
Snektron
mq32:

1567072593
Snektron
could always use something like that

1567072704
mq32
yeah

1567072730
mq32
but it would break if you leave the safe space of "everything is my own code"

1567072764
mq32
also 2D slices must be more complex than your example (would require arbitrary subslicing for ranges)

1567072803
Snektron
thats true

1567072849
bgiannan
huh but i could just store everything in one dimension

1567072858
Snektron
You'll need to store the backing array's dimensions

1567072901
mq32
bgiannan: for 2D slices you need to store slice width/height, a start pointer and the actual array stride

1567072911
mq32
would be really cool if we had 2D slices, would make a lot of stuff much easier (like image processing)

1567073125
Snektron
All functionality to implement it in userspace is there

1567073140
Snektron
You're just missing [] syntax really

1567073539
Snektron


1567073641
Snektron
i guess a range type could be useful for this. It could behave similarly to a slice where its just a struct { lower: usize, upper: ?usize };

1567073755
rivten
mq32 : what made you say "nope" afterwards ? :p  because indeed from godbolt this seems to work

1567075546
mq32
rivten, godbolt only compiles an object file, but does not link

1567075559
mq32
and it seems like the upstream version of zig (from the download page) still fails to compile

1567075682
mq32
Snektron, yeah i know that i can do this in user space without problems

1567075702
mq32
also my point is not that i'm missing [], but standardization

1567075723
mq32
(and the need to copy-paste for every nth-dimension i need because we can't do this with comptime)=

1567077046
Snektron
you can do the last part too, albeit with some workarounds

1567077066
mq32
ah yeah

1567077070
mq32
i can go another abstraction layer

1567077076
Snektron
you can take a comptime []usize for the dimensions

1567077077
mq32
and use array parameters

1567077099
Snektron
it would be nicer if there was some kind of way to make varargs of a specific type

1567077111
mq32
comptime L : comptime_int, dimensions : [L]usize

1567078486
bgiannan
if i have this slice `[]const *MyStruct` shouldn't i be able to modify members of MyStruct ?

1567080825
samtebbs
bgiannan: Nope, it's const

1567080841
bgiannan
does non-const slices exist?

1567081158
mq32
samtebbs: why is the data pointed to const? in my reading, this is a "A slice of const pointers to non-const MyStruct"

1567081481
bgiannan
^ mpq32, my thought exactly

1567081830
samtebbs
mq32, bgiannan: Yep you're correct, I misplaced the asterisk

1567081961
bgiannan
so i have a `[]const *Self.Cell` and when i try to modify one of the cell like so: `for (self.grid) |*cell| { cell.*.light = light; }`, zig gives me this error: `cannot assign to constant`

1567082117
samtebbs
In this case cell must be the const. Could you paste the full error?

1567082465
Tetralux
bgiannan: Non-const slices do exist btw :p

1567082475
Tetralux
They're what you normally use.

1567082544
bgiannan
samtebbs,

1567082565
bgiannan
Tetralux, how do you initialize a non-const slice?

1567082691
Tetralux
They're what you normally use.

1567082701
Tetralux
whoops wrong chat

1567082741
Tetralux
bgiannan: var x = [_]u8{...}; var s = x[0..];

1567082745
Tetralux
Or allocate it.

1567082763
bgiannan
huh i did that

1567082772
bgiannan
and zig said i was giving a const slice

1567082779
Tetralux
I suspect it has something to do with how you did.

1567082800
bgiannan
i guess

1567082814
bgiannan
`([_]*Self.Cell{&Self.defaultCell(allocator)} ** (width * height))[0..]`

1567082855
fengb
You need to assign the array somewhere

1567082883
fengb
Otherwise youâ€™re slicing a literal, which zig interprets as a const

1567082889
samtebbs
bgiannan: Looking at the docs it does seem possible to assign to the iterator variable, so `light` must be constant within the struct.

1567082937
bgiannan
fengb, pulling out the array enables me to have a non-const slice, thx!

1567082948
bgiannan
samtebbs, no the light field is not constant

1567082960
bgiannan
it's optional however

1567082996
Tetralux
I believe the idea is that when you see 'var', it means "this creates storage on the stack for the thing I am assigning to it"

1567083009
Tetralux
It may be copied in, or may be directly written in.

1567083016
Tetralux
But either way, it's stored in the var.

1567083028
Tetralux
Meaning that if you don't have it, the you cannot mutate it.

1567083052
Tetralux
.. since it'll be comptime evalutated if it can, and put in the static segment.

1567083075
Tetralux
I believe that's how that works.

1567084062
Snektron
Does nakedcc automatically generate a return instruction?

1567084380
samtebbs
Snektron: It does, set the return type to "noreturn" to not generate one

1567084428
Tetralux
I still don't understand how a function cannot return.

1567084432
Tetralux
It seems so alien xD

1567084457
Tetralux
"The kernel does something" is about all I've got.

1567084467
samtebbs
It's good for a kernel's entry symbol since you don't want to be going back to the bootloader

1567084568
Tetralux
I guess you just fall off the end of the function and keep going... except I wonder how the entry point for a program works.

1567084605
Tetralux
The kernel put a runtime longjmp after the function or something?

1567084607
Snektron
samtebbs: no i want it to return, just not sure

1567084628
Snektron
i think that should be correct

1567084877
gonz_
alexander92: Did you manage to get it compiling?

1567084903
gonz_
bgiannan sent this right before you disappeared: 09:42:36 <bgiannan> alexander92, are you sure your zig commands points to the downloaded binary and not some other one?

1567084955
FireFox317
So cool to see 'clashos' working on a physical raspberry pi 3b!

1567085008
alexander92
hey, thank you gonz_ i did

1567085013
alexander92
i wrote a simple program in zig

1567085032
alexander92
i might play more with it later after work

1567085499
samtebbs
Tetralux: where would you jump to though? :)

1567085593
gonz_
alexander92: Great. :)

1567085924
Snektron
Tetralux: remember that a kernel has a notion of processes. When a program ends the process simply ends

1567085987
Snektron
the program ends by calling an exit syscall usually, at which point i'd guess the process is just removed from the list of active ones

1567086030
Snektron
if the exit syscall isnt called it will just continue trying to execute the memory after the _start function which will probably soon result in a fault

1567086615
ntgg
why does this segfault?

1567087012
ntgg
I'm building on the latest master

1567087072
ntgg
the traceback says the return is where it happens

1567087313
FireFox317_
ntgg: You have to 'try' allocStruct because it can fail

1567087340
FireFox317_
However a segfault is always a bug in the compiler

1567087500
ntgg
the try allocStruct isn't the issue

1567087538
andrewrk
a segfault in the compiler is always a bug in the compiler. a segfault in zig code at runtime is not necessarily a bug in the compiler because zig is not memory safe

1567087551
ntgg
It's not a segfault while compiling

1567087571
samtebbs
segfault while testing?

1567087580
ntgg
yeah

1567088398
Tetralux
samtebbs: I mean yeah - but the kernel needs a way to know when the program ends. Like, you could have the program jump to some code that marks itself as finished, but that might be a security issue.

1567088455
andrewrk
mq32, what's this about the source tarball from the download page not working?

1567088535
samtebbs
Tetralux: Oh I'm talking about the kernel's entry point, rather than a program's

1567088561
samtebbs
Snektron is right in saying that a program will call a syscall when it's finished

1567088645
samtebbs
What type would I give to a parameter if I want to pass it the result of an import?

1567088736
samtebbs
If I have `const foo = @import("foo.zig"); fn use_foo(bar: ?) {}`, I would like to call use_foo with foo.

1567088766
kristoff_it
samtebbs: `var`? :D

1567088796
mq32
andrewrk, just the known problem with i386-windwos

1567088806
andrewrk
ah ok

1567088838
mq32
Tetralux, Linux kills programs by making a syscall (interrupt + number in register)

1567088860
mq32
if that syscall is "exit(exitCode)" the program will be terminated

1567088875
mq32
so there is a jump into a code not known to the program itself (the interrupt handler)

1567088893
mq32
just imagine this like a task switch with no switching back

1567088952
ntgg
If I move the Union{ .Struct = s } to outside of the function it works correctly

1567089088
Snektron
why is the target passed to zig with -target and not --target?

1567089095
Snektron
but strip is --strip

1567089124
andrewrk
Snektron, copying existing flags for other programs, rather than trying to be consistent about - or --

1567089207
Snektron
it seems more inconsistent to me now

1567089223
Snektron
oh wait i read that wrong

1567089277
andrewrk
the CLI flags are pretty unstable at this point. don't worry, closer to 1.0 we can do a pass and organize everything

1567089495
Snektron
I need a global read from the auxv. for the arm stuff. Where should i initialize that?

1567089519
andrewrk
Snektron, is this something that belongs in std/special/start.zig?

1567089547
Snektron
the method to retrieve the thread pointer depends on HWCAP from the auxv

1567089555
Snektron
So i guess?

1567089573
Snektron
I can also just put hwcap in linux.zig and initialize it alongside elf_aux_maybe

1567089573
andrewrk
what std lib function is this for?

1567089586
andrewrk
getCurrentId?

1567089612
Snektron
No, its actually a funciton to retrieve the current thread pointer

1567089620
Snektron
like the opposite of what setThreadPointer does

1567089645
andrewrk
this is new code? not trying to get existing code to work with arm?

1567089692
Snektron
on arm its a pseudoinstruction which llvm emits as a call to __aeabi_read_tp and expects libc to provide that. Theres an option in llvm to emit it directly like on other platforms, but that depends on some subfeature setting or whatever its called

1567089720
andrewrk
what std lib function is this for?

1567089774
Snektron
Im just trying to improve arm32 support, like i said. If there is a thread local in a zig program, the compiler crashes because there is an undefined reference to __aeabi_read_tp

1567089792
andrewrk
ok I see

1567089806
andrewrk
so you're trying to implement __aeabi_read_tp

1567089825
Snektron
yes

1567089866
Snektron
that function can be implemented in two ways: using a coprocessor instruction

1567089880
Snektron
or with a kernel helper function, on older kernels i guess

1567089897
Snektron
well, or it can be retrieved by a syscall

1567089959
Snektron
The linux kernel decides how it can be retrieved by reading the HWCAP auxv. If it contains HWCAP_TLS, it provides the thread pointer via the coprocessor instruction. If it doesn't, its a helper function

1567089998
andrewrk
ok I get the idea now. I think the first thing I would try would be to put this functionality in std/special/start.zig

1567090015
andrewrk
if that file is used, it's because the program is not being linked with libc

1567090037
andrewrk
sorry, it's always included. but you can look at link_libc

1567090055
andrewrk
and then you can conditionally export the __aeabi_read_tp function

1567090114
andrewrk
the auxv is sort of a runtime value, so actually maybe __aeabi_read_tp would be in std/special/c.zig for this target

1567090173
andrewrk
yeah, I think __aeabi_read_tp belongs in std/special/c.zig (or a file imported by it) and then std/os/linux/tls.zig can be improved with arm32 support. the initTLS function reads the aux vector

1567090182
Snektron
Can i also put it in std/os/linux/arm-eabi.zig and export it from std/special/c.zig?

1567090226
andrewrk
that would work, yes, but why not put it under the std/special/c/ directory?

1567090247
Snektron
figured it could go nicely with the other architecture-dependent stuff

1567090252
Snektron
either will work fine i guess

1567090254
andrewrk
yeah that does make sense, go for it

1567090273
andrewrk
sorry, I'm reasoning through this at the same time as you :)

1567090325
andrewrk
ntgg, thanks for filing the issue

1567090408
Snektron
by the way, i seem to get a compile error when doing builtin.arch == .arm

1567090474
andrewrk
builtin.Arch is a tagged union

1567090495
andrewrk
arm has the Arm32 sub-arch enum to choose from

1567090525
andrewrk
oh, you just want to compare tags though. that makes sense.

1567090535
Snektron
yes

1567090546
andrewrk


1567090566
Snektron
Its already being tracked, cool

1567092647
nrdmn
Looks like there's a java framework called quarkus that has a bytecode generator that writes files with names ending in .zig

1567092720

if someone pushes this bytecode to github, it falsely detects this as zig and labels the repo as a zig repo

samtebbs
kristoff_it: I tried that but got `error: parameter of type 'type' requires comptime`. The code I'm passing the struct to can't be comptime

1567092891
Snektron
So the alternative non-register-tls thing requires calling a kernel helper function, yet im not sure how to do that exactly and i don't have a kernel i can test that on either

1567092898
Snektron
Should i just put @panic("TODO") there?

1567092982
kristoff_it
samtebbs: I think it's fine. it's asking you to mark the parameter as comptime, not the whole function. change it to `fn foo(comptime bar: var)`. The function will still be callable at runtime, it's just the parameter that needs comptime

1567092989
samtebbs
kristoff_it: Oh nevermind it just wanted the parameter to be comptime :D

1567092994
Snektron
oh also, the method i tried crashes the compiler

1567093003
samtebbs
kristoff_it: thanks

1567093006
kristoff_it
samtebbs: yep :)

1567093428
kristoff_it
samtebbs: also I just noticed that the compiler gave you a good hint: bar is of type `type`, so you can use that instead of `var`

1567094995
samtebbs
kristoff_it: Very true! What's the difference?

1567095101
fengb
var can be anything. type needs to be a type

1567095123
kristoff_it
samtebbs: types are stuff like a specific struct definition, `i64`, `[3]u8` etc, usually we call those "types". While `var` arguments can be all the things I just mentioned plus instances of any of these things, like `"hello"` or 5, or `[3]u8{'l', 'o', 'l'}`

1567095227
kristoff_it
`var` is one order of magnitude more generic than `type`, in some sense.

mikdusan
andrewrk: i need a pair of eyes to review if I'm doing correct IrBasicBlock setup for IR slice bounds checking. I added a detailed comment against the WIP:

1567101437
mikdusan
ie: `ir_set_cursor_at_end_and_append_block()` and `ir_set_cursor_at_end()`

1567101448
andrewrk
mikdusan, I'll have a look

1567101487
mikdusan
hints or guesses welcome.

1567101590
andrewrk
still looking at the code, but note that the order of ir_create_basic_block is not important, but the order of ir_set_cursor_at_end_and_append_block is important

1567101612
andrewrk
so for example in an if statement, it's required that the then block and else block are before the endif block

1567101692
andrewrk
there's some extra hoops you have to jump through after result locations now too, you can see it in ir_gen_if_bool_expr

1567101703
andrewrk
the peer parent thing is required

1567101730
andrewrk
as well as the ir_build_end_expr with the result locations set up

1567101741
andrewrk
even if everything is void

1567101764
andrewrk
maybe you can omit that stuff if everything is guaranteed void

1567101861
andrewrk
mikdusan, I don't see ir_set_cursor_at_end_and_append_block for pass_block, is the pass_block getting appended to the basic block list anywhere?

1567101895
mikdusan
i just do this: `ir_set_cursor_at_end(&ira->new_irb, pass_block);`

1567101932
andrewrk
the use cases for ir_set_cursor_at_end are rare and advanced

1567101947
andrewrk
why not ir_set_cursor_at_end_and_append_block there?

1567101960
mikdusan
using the _and_append caused the block to duplicate in IR output

1567101972
andrewrk
where else is it getting appended?

1567102039
andrewrk
you also need to pass is_comptime. it's not allowed to be null for pass1 instructions

1567102071
andrewrk
in ir_build_cond_br

1567102249
mikdusan
added another comment showing what happens when using _and_append

1567102305
andrewrk
you'll have to debug it and figure out why that's happening. the fix is not ir_set_cursor_at_end

1567102315
andrewrk
this is not a contributor friendly issue

1567102343
mikdusan
ok thanks for the hints.

1567102348
andrewrk
I mean, not to discourage you, but this is difficult

1567102456
mikdusan
yeah i get it. i'm bypassing all the AST->IR logic and goodness and writing direct IR. expecting it wasn't going to be easy :)

1567102459
andrewrk
I'm not even 100% sure that moving the safety check code to ir pass 2 will solve the problem, I'd want to think that through a bit more before trying to implement it

1567102476
andrewrk
one complication is @setRuntimeSafety

1567102502
andrewrk
it's a bit convenient for example that that function participates in comptime, and then in the llvm ir pass, only then do we read the value

1567102553
andrewrk
I don't even foresee doing this in stage1. I was thinking it would make sense to have data flow analysis first

1567102572
andrewrk
yeah tbh even if you had a working implementation of this, if it complicates stage1 it might not even be worth it

1567102587
andrewrk
isn't that issue tagged with milestone 1.1.0?

1567102618
mikdusan
yes

1567102652
mikdusan
well there's #1839 and #2649

1567102762
andrewrk
ah right

1567105101
gunnara
hi! If I'd like to target xbox, how would I do that? I read the tier system docs and I believe this would be Tier 3 or 4?

1567105104
gunnara


1567105179
andrewrk
hi gunnara, what architecture is xbox?

1567105197
andrewrk
x86_64?

1567105219
gunnara
yes

1567105228
mq32
xbox one is x86_64, but the older ones are â€¦ Power PC i think

1567105258
andrewrk
zig should do just fine. just the parts of the std lib that depend on operating system stuff won't be available

1567105261
gunnara
right, I'm not the expert, glad to get help

1567105265
gunnara


1567105336
gunnara
andrewrk, thanks! How do I determine what depend on "opearting system stuff"?

1567105356
andrewrk
you'll get a compile error if it won't work

1567105370
andrewrk
but anything that's not OS-specific such as std.ArrayList will work fine

1567105403
gunnara
awesome!

1567105410
andrewrk
I'm guessing there's an xbox SDK that provides a libc. you'll probably rely heavily on this

1567105458
andrewrk
you're the first person trying to do this with zig, so you're gonna have to be a pioneer, but feel free to ask for as much help as you want here, of course :)

1567105505
gunnara
andrewrk cool, I'm really happy about the "you'll get compile error it it won't work". That gives me confidence (and some headaches too of course) :)

1567105535
andrewrk
zig is pretty good about not introducing OS dependencies where they aren't necessary

1567105765
FireFox317
gunnara: Do you have a way to run code on the xbox?

1567105872
bgiannan
no matter how i try to instanciate my slice, i get a `unable to evaluate constant expression` i think because of the fact that the size is not comptime known

1567105907
bgiannan
i tried with an array then sliced and with allocator.alloc

1567106073
nitram91
Hello, has anybody tried to do something similar to writing a dynamic linker in zig ? I can't figure out my build.rs (but I can build the project manually)

1567106657
nitram91
Can anyone give me a bit of help with build.rs ?

1567106749
andrewrk
nitram91, you're in #zig

1567106785
nitram91
oh sorry, I meant build.zig, I'm tired sorry

1567106827
nitram91
I've given up on trying to use rust for my project, but zig seems great because it doesn't depend on libc

1567106867
andrewrk
I'm sure people would be willing to help, if you ask a question with details such as what you tried to do, and what you expected or wanted to happen, and a link to the output you actually got

1567106885
nitram91
ok, I'll try to write something up

1567107091
bgiannan
andrewrk, any idea why something like `allocator.alloc(*MyType, width * height);` would get me a `unable to evaluate constant expression` in alignedAlloc ?

1567107131
andrewrk
can I see the output?

1567107190
bgiannan
andrewrk,

1567107244
bgiannan
i tried a slice before and had the same error but on the slice initialization itself, so something must be off on my part for sure i just don't see what

1567107317
andrewrk
bgiannan, you're using Level.init(...) as a default value for a struct field

1567107322
andrewrk
which means it's getting run at compile time

1567107339
andrewrk
you can't allocate heap memory at compile time. related:

1567107360
andrewrk
I suggest not using the default struct field value feature

1567107362
bgiannan
ah thank you that makes sense

1567107374
bgiannan
be on this all day your saving me

1567107381
bgiannan
you're*

1567107388
andrewrk
the "called from here" trace points back to level: Level, that's how I know

1567107454
bgiannan
right i just didn't have the notion that default struct field values where evaluated at compile time

1567107461
andrewrk
yeah there are no constructors

1567107526
andrewrk
none of this nonsense:

1567107557
bgiannan
ah nice now i'm getting a seg fault from `zig build`

1567107790
nitram91
Hello, I'm trying to write a dynamic linker in zig (I've done it in C and I want to give zig a try).So I'm trying to compile two files:  - main.zig, in which I just have a hello world for now.  - _start.s, in which I jump to my main function which is located in main.zigWhen I compile and link manually, everything works out. I basically just do:  zi

1567107790
nitram91
g build-obj --assembly src/_start.s --disable-pic src/main.zig  ld -no-pie -o ld.so main.oBut I can't get my build.zig to do the same thing .Also the -no-pie option is very important, I don't want relocations in my executable.Does anyone have tips on how to achieve this ? I've spent a good few hours reading the source code of std/builder.zigand the

1567107791
nitram91
only thing that looked like it could help me was addObject and addAssembly but the compiler is now complaining about unreachable code.Also sorry if this is not how IRC works, it's my first time, I'd gladly learn.

1567107806
nitram91
ow, formating broke, it's unreadable

1567107865
andrewrk
nitram91, what do you need _start.s for?

1567107892
nitram91
it has my _start function, since I'm writing a dynamic linker I need to control precisely how my program start

1567107923
andrewrk
ah ok. Well that will work fine. You can also export _start from zig, like this:

1567108042
shachaf
Hmm, does that entry point set the stack base pointer to 0?

1567108056
andrewrk
nitram91, this works for me:

1567108080
andrewrk
shachaf, no, why?

1567108086
Snektron
andrewrk: did you see what i wrote earlier about how i can't verify if the kernel helper function will work or not?

1567108097
andrewrk
no I did not see that

1567108141
shachaf
The amd64 ABI says you should set rbp to 0 in the outermost stack frame.

1567108175
andrewrk
I'm guessing the linux kernel does that before invoking _start. otherwise I agree it should be added

1567108194
nitram91
shachaf yes, but when I compile manually, everything works, I'm just trying to setup build.zig

1567108214
nitram91
andrewrk I'm going to try and I'll let you know

1567108254
shachaf
Hmm, maybe it does. The ABI says that it's unspecified and user code should set it to 0.

1567108262
Snektron
andrewrk: The device i imply to run Zig programs on supports the hardware based tls register stuff. That means i can't really test the alternative method with the kernel function, plus im not sure if im calling it correctly (and the method i used generates a compiler assertion failure). Should i add it and hope it works, or just detect if the alternative method should be used, panic, and leaving some pointers for future

1567108262
Snektron
reference?

1567108326
andrewrk
nitram91, ah, I'm sorry, you're trying to output ld.so. I'd have to play around with this a little bit. The code I gave you will produce an executable binary

1567108327
cgag
this mean anything to anyone? lld: error: undefined symbol: __gxx_personality_v0

1567108338
andrewrk
cgag, I think that's a c++ dependency

1567108347
andrewrk
you may need to link libc++ or something like that

1567108352
andrewrk
or don't depend on c++

1567108389
andrewrk
Snektron, I think panicking and leaving it for a future implementation is good, if you can't test it

1567108426
Snektron
In that case, i'm pretty confident that most stuff works now.

1567108464
andrewrk
nitram91, there is currently no way to guarantee -no-pie on the linker line, but that's a good use case

1567108491
andrewrk
nitram91, would you mind opening an issue explaining what you're trying to accomplish? then we can make long term plans, and give you a workaround to unblock you

1567108531
nitram91
andrewrk the name of the output isn't too important. I'm running into an issue with your build.zig, the install method apparently doesn't exist.

1567108552
andrewrk
nitram91, I'd suggest using a master branch build at this point. 0.4.0 is many commits behind

1567108563
andrewrk
next release is sept 30

1567108572
nitram91
ok, ill do that

1567108628
nitram91
and yes my issue is mainly not being able to pass -no-pie to the linker. Also when I link manually my executable works with lld but it's broken with GNU ld (bfd ld)

1567108687
Snektron
btw, is comptime []u8 support for asm an idea? could allow for a more streamlined implementation of syscall(), considering the weird syscall method of 32 bit linux

1567108741
andrewrk
Snektron, I'm pretty sure inline assembly is just a comptime string

1567108814
Snektron
asm("" + ""); yields a parse error

1567108816
andrewrk
nitram91, I believe if you do build-exe and then give it a .so extension it will be no-pie

1567108826
andrewrk
Snektron, the operator is ++

1567108859
Snektron
typo on irc

1567108871
andrewrk
oh yeah, ok looking at the grammar it's a string literal

1567108888
andrewrk
I would invite you to open a proposal to change that to an expression

1567108901
Snektron
sure, i'll write that up later

1567109583
nitram91
can I set the entry point to something other than main ? (I just want execution to start at my _start function)

1567110197
Tetralux
nitram91: I believe you can just define a `export nakedcc fn _start() noreturn {}` as it'll use that as the entry point.

1567110209
Tetralux
I've never used it, but I think that's how that works.

1567110259
nitram91
it does work, but I didn't define a main function and the compiler seems to be complaining about that

1567110759
FireFox317
nitram91: Currently that only works when using build-obj, i think there is an open issue for allowing _start to be defined using build-exe

1567110825
FireFox317


1567110972
nitram91
FireFox317 indeed, that's the only way to get it to work. But since reading the definition of the_start function in the zig source code I realised I don't need my own start.

1567110993
nitram91
But thank you very much, the feature could still be useful.

1567111073
nitram91
and thank you andrewrk for answering my questions, the link to the zig source code actually helped me a lot. I'm just starting out with zig but I really like the "minimalism" of zig.

1567111936
Snektron
I think the _start problem can be fixed relatively simply by doing if (@hasDecl(root, "_start")) { @export("_start", root._start, .Strong); } else { @export("_start"), _start, .Strong} in start.zig

1567112336
shritesh
Is there a way to export a default struct from a file? I remember something related when @import("root") was introduced but I can't find the issue right now.

1567116020
Tetralux
shritesh: A 'default' strucT?

1567117036
cgag
andrewrk: maybe a dumb question, how do I link against libc++?  I see libc++.so in /usr/lib64, and have -isystem /usr/lib64, but --library c++ complains "unable to find library -lc++"

1567117049
cgag
works for c, GL, glfw, etc

1567117174
cgag
oh, didn't have libcxx-devel

1567117313
cgag
drawing lines with the skia via nornagon's skia-zig demo, it's a miracle.  Building and linking all this incredibly difficult.
