when I try to mutate the array, but not if I only read it.

same original code, just comment the line `atest.value[0] = 0;` and you don't get bad access

i think you found a bug in zig

Haha :D

don't tell Andrew

or we should

what do you think? :D

Hey andrewrk, I left a comment on this commit referencing an issue, but the issue doesn't show a link back:

I just wanted to confirm because the title is mismatched -- remove binary/octal but keep hex float literals, yeah?

can I test whether a variable is comptime?

I saw "zig cc" was added and thought I'd give it a try. I created helloworld.c which compiles with `clang helloworld.c` and runs. I tried `zig cc helloworld.c` and I got an error "/usr/include/stdio.h:33:10: fatal error: 'stddef.h' file not found". I see #2010 "add documentaiotn for using Zig as a C compiler" so no wonder there are no docs. Should

I be able to compile a c program or may `zig cc` is just for non-main c files?

andrewrk
zig cc is deprecated

1553897815
andrewrk
use --c-source

1553898148
andrewrk
actually I don't think zig cc is deprecated. it's just really low level, meant to be used by tools, not users directly

1553898164
andrewrk
zig build-exe --c-source helloworld.c --library c

Bravo that worked, txs.

you can also try some of the cross compiled libc targets, which you can see a listing of with `zig targets`

1553898962

Will it compile c++, just wondering?

1553898994
andrewrk
it can compile c++ but I haven't looked into the link dependencies of c++ yet

1553899461
wink_
got it, for grins I tried `$ ./build/bin/zig build-exe --c-source ../hw.cpp --library c` it failed 'stdio' file not found. and then output the `zig cc ...` command line that failed. I see why "cc" isn't designed for people, its 643 characters long :)

hmmmm, *u21 can't cast to *u32. Why don't we guarantee that u17--u31 all have 32-bit alignment?

1553900668
scientes
or might u17-u24 be staggered into 3-bytes, with 1-bytes alignment I guess----maybe if I do Align(4) it could be allowed to up-cast?

speaking of cross compiled libc targets...how long does it take others to build all the glibc targets? I didn't even build the musl libs yet, but all the glibc stuff took just over 3 hours on a massive 64 core AMD EPYC server!! The same machine compiles llvm/clang/lld/compiler-rt in 6m23s! Anyways, just letting others know glibcs will probably take a LONG time to compile :)

1553902996
scientes
did you run all the tests?

1553903009
scientes
oh yes

1553903831
wilsonk
just followed along running the scripts as per:

1553903882
wilsonk
which does seem to have a 'check' stage, so perhaps those are tests? Not totally sure
