Is there an idiomatic way in zig to splitting a u8 into 2 u4â€™s? I was thinking of using @truncate with some bitwise operations but was wondering if there was another way

fengb: you're not a dumb person. Rust just has a lot of cognitive overhead, as in, one has to think and follow its rules all of the time. Which for me as a former Rust programmer was very stressful and wears me out.

I felt like I age faster with Rust

Is there a way to generate a large statically sized array using the same value for each element in a repeated fashion?

[_]T{T.init} ** size

"error: unable to evaluate constant expression"   ...  ðŸ˜

If it weren't for that error I might've been able to solve issue #2885

stratact: if T.init is comptime, it should work

1568549795
mq32
otherwise a for loop will do the work (if .init is known at runtime)

1568550291

mq32: I appreciate it, but T.init wasn't the problem. I suppose I'm trying to, at runtime, set the size of the static array, because I need it to reassign with a new len each time (without allocating because the issue doesn't want the allocator anymore).

1568550312
stratact
Sounds like I should go with the for loop approach

1568550346
mq32
stratact, is this about storage for a file path?

1568550355
mq32
you can use PATH_MAX or similar macros/limits of the OS for this

1568550391
stratact
I think it has to do with getting the next Dir entry

1568550445

Here is an example of code I'm trying to refactor without the allocator:

1568550532
stratact
The problem comes mostly from line 741, where it needs to realloc a new buffer with twice the size

1568550558
stratact
I don't know how to emulate that without allocation

1568550633
stratact
but whatever the case, andrewrk wants that allocator gone

1568550881
mq32
you could make the function take a buffer instead of an allocator

1568550886
mq32
and just assume fix-size for the buffer

1568551102
stratact
Oh yeah... I can pass a fixed size buffer instead and make it a slice. You're a genius mq32 :)

1568551124
mq32
haha

1568551203

Usually the simplest solutions are the best ones. I've been banging my head on this for the past couple of days.

1568551255
mq32
yeah it's hard to learn to find simple solutions

1568551274
mq32
i'm struggling right now in my project and i have a "solution" now that will possibly break horribly

1568551302
stratact
ðŸ˜…

1568551317
mq32
hell, i have a type that is

1568551324
mq32
call that good design! :D

1568553063
stratact
mq32: remember when you said it was file path related? It's file path related :)

unexpected errno: 22

Someone please kill me

1568554740
mq32
errno 22 is invalid argument

1568554761
mq32
is your buffer too small?

1568554775
mq32
if i remember the docs right it is the errno you get when the buffer is too small

1568554808
stratact
I see

1568554847
stratact
I did try with using MAX_PATH_BYTES and std.mem.page_size, but that's not enough apparently

1568554975
stratact
oh boy, how big does this buffer need to be?

1568555018
mq32
MAX_PATH_BYTES + sizeof(dirent-structure used) + some buffer i think

1568555444
stratact
mq32: I appreciate the help. I need to lie down for a bit. Got a huge headache ;)

1568555470
mq32
yeah i got to clean up some stuff here, should do that :D

Random thought: Why is the alignment argument in Allocator a u29 and not a usize?

1568591077
Tetralux
Or a u32, u64, etc.

To make it unique?
