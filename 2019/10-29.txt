Actually using ACPI now :) "ACPI 1.0 detected, assuming i8042 controller presence..."

Or, for later revisions, actually checking before initializing

... ugh. On real hardware (amd64 in legacy mode), anything involving floats (f32/f64) craps out and gives nan

1572319781
daurnimator
real hardware would be in real mode though ;)

I'm new to os dev but my understanding is the goal is to get out of legacy mode as soon as possible

1572319925
pixelherodev
"legacy mode" meaning BIOS emulation

1572319937
pixelherodev
Also meaning this runs as a x86 kernel, not x64

But yeah, really sick of QEMU trying to hold my hands and work when it shouldn't.

1572320367
andrewrk
I think that's rather a missing feature of QEMU than an anti feature

1572320420
andrewrk
it's a lot easier to test (from the perspective of a QEMU developer) that it is able to emulate working software, than it is to test whether it emulates non-working software the same way as the hardware

It doesn't require enabling the FPU. I'd say "probably not hard to emulate," but I've never tried and I try not to assume knowledge

1572340739
Snektron
Floats have all kind of weird intrinsics, if you want to emulate an FPU you gotta implement all those

1572340745
Snektron
Like rounding modes

this just dropped in my inbox:

mq32: Oh nice, never heard of it before

Has anyone here tried to use std.debug.openDwarfDebugInfo on freestanding i386?

1572359460
samtebbs
It's working on x86_64-linux, i386-linux, arm-linux and aarch64-linux but returns InvalidDebugInfo on i386-freestanding

samtebbs, bgiannan is here and i think he announced that he started rewriting the game in zig :)

1572378360
bgiannan
mq32, samtebbs, yeah i did :)

What language is it currently in?

1572379689
bgiannan
lua

1572379694
bgiannan
with love 2d

are you talking about the dwarf-fortress-lite game?

1572379766
bgiannan
yes. even though it has little to do with DF apart from the visual style

1572385675
nrdmn
is there a rough timeframe for lambdas?

1572385767
pixelherodev
Don't we already basically have lambdas using e.g. `struct {fn func()void{}}.func`?

1572386278
nrdmn
pixelherodev: error: expected type 'extern fn(...) usize', found '(bound extern fn(...) usize)'

1572386287
nrdmn
what's 'bound'?

1572386346
andrewrk
it's a "fat pointer" that only works at comptime and the type only exists to make method call syntax work

1572386365
pixelherodev
Snektron, true, but this is using KVM, so AFAIK it's not strictly speaking

1572386420
fengb
pixelherodev: those are just local "anonymous" functions. True closures can capture local state

1572386494
pixelherodev
In theory, if you design a system to call the function with the containing struct (and take type `var` in the function), you might be able to do that

1572386507
pixelherodev
Also, I was talking lambdas, not closures

1572388742
fengb
Oh right
