hi, has anyone else errors with newlines not being '\n' on compiler explorer ?

Hey everyone, can anyone tell me if there is a sscanf type function? I see parseUnsigned and such.

can anyone point me to a repo with tests on functions that take file pointers so I can model my function tests after that?

Any way to get more visibility into what the compiler is doing when using `zig build test`? I'm getting the following message when trying to test my project

vegecode, I believe Jimmi (hejsil) has a proof-of-concept of a sscanf-like API

probably in his "fun-with-zig" repo

It only started failing to build when I added the functions dealing with `HashMap`s, so I guess I've broken something along the way there

euantor, --verbose will list commands before executing them

1547411841
euantor
Awesome, will try that thanks

1547411847
andrewrk
but it should also print the last command that failed after it fails even without --verbose

vegecode
Thanks.

Damn, that didn't get me too much further. I did just notice I didn't finish implementing hash() full though, so I guess I'll fix that then try again.

euantor, it looks like zig, the compiler, is crashing, which is a bug in zig

1547412003
andrewrk
you can run the command again and see what it says: /usr/local/bin/zig/zig test /app/src/main.zig --output /app/zig-cache/test

1547412019
euantor
Ok, will try that then

1547412124
andrewrk
and then I'll give you the standard "you hit a compiler bug" instructions: 1. sorry about that, that's why we're still early beta 2. if you can reduce it down to a small test case, that's the best way to get it resolved, and for me to offer a workaround in the meantime

1547412151
euantor
Not a problem. I'll play some more and see wha I can figure out

1547413081
andrewrk
euantor, also if you're willing to use a debugger I can instruct you how to look at the backtrace and find out, in the source code, what caused the crash

1547413292
euantor
Great, thanks. Iâ€™m stepping away from the computer for an hour or so - might end up taking you up on that tomorrow

vegecode
Could someone take a look and tell me why I'm getting this error?

I'll be back shortly

1547413729
andrewrk
we need a better error for this, but first of all your && isn't doing what you think it's doing

1547413771
andrewrk
actually that was the problem

1547413777
andrewrk
I'll open an error for this

vegecode,
