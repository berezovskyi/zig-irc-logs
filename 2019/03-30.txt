andrewrk:  when zig is linking c libraries should it preferentially link to the static ones, or the dynamic ones?

i just got mingw to link libc successfully!

i get "lld-link: warning: found both wmain and main; using latter" though

was there a breaking change that made orelse stop working with c pointer?

the following won't compile because of that.

I really wish zig had multiple return values. Is there any problem in the grammer with this?

I see a problem with how to handle errors

1553968125

I guess it is fine how it is, it is just kinda ugly to have ret_foo pointers as arguments

1553968149

actually, it would make the language more functional, and then allow more functions to be labeled PURE

this will be solved with no-copy semantics + anonymous array literals

are enum literals supposed to work for union(enum) as well?

1553969841
andrewrk
yes when the field type is void

1553970859
scientes
but arrays can only have one type???

1553970863
scientes
can you give an example

1553970888
scientes
you mean annonymous struct literals?

how does one add a pull request to an github issue? i assume preference is create issue for tracking, attach pull request to issue ?

1553971014

mikdusan, in the commit write "Closes: #1234", and then submit the pull request

1553971030
scientes
in git

I'm getting a TODO crash in stage1 on const_values_equal for error unions

1553982233

and if I just return false, I am getting a crash at get_error_union_type(CodeGen*, ZigType*, ZigType*): Assertion `payload_type->di_type' failed.
