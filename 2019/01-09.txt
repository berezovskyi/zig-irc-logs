What is the correct way to access a field on an optional pointer to a c struct (?*struct_foobar)?  I've tried accessing it directly, dereferencing, and dereferencing after checking for null

hi n3t

testuser678, struct_foobar.?.*

1546995518
andrewrk
this asserts that it is not null, then dereferences it

1546995581
andrewrk
I can advise better if you show me some code

i just found out the zig grammar for syntax high-lighting doesn't work on escaped strings like "\"hello\"".

1547010886
testuser678
andrewrk: still doesn't seem to be working.  Threw my code in a gist here:

1547010954
testuser678
Note that the gist doesn't reflect exactly what you said, but I tried that also - the error I'm getting is `error: type 'struct_nfq_q_handle' does not support field access`

testuser678: I think you have a pointer to a pointer there

1547011435
daurnimator
or maybe not.

testuser678, build with --verbose-cimport and have a look at the warnings. or `zig translate-c foo.h --verbose-cimport` where `foo.h` has #include <libnetfilter_queue/libnetfilter_queue.h> in it

1547012117
andrewrk
have a look at the warnings as well as the outputted zig code

1547012162
andrewrk
I'm guessing it says "downgraded struct_nfq_q_handle to opaque type because XYZ"

1547012189
testuser678
Awesome, I'll check it out

1547012191
testuser678
Thanks all

1547012609
testuser678
I don't see that error message, but `pub const struct_nfq_q_handle = @OpaqueType();` is there

1547015678
daurnimator
testuser678: what about nfq_q_handle itself?

1547015869
daurnimator
Tried locally and I see: `pub const nfq_q_handle = struct_nfq_q_handle`

1547015992
daurnimator
andrewrk: --verbose-cimport doesn't seem to do anything

1547016074
daurnimator
testuser678: uh wait

1547016083
daurnimator
testuser678: looking at the header. it

1547016091
daurnimator
testuser678: your link goes to the private definition

1547017650
testuser678
daurnimator: Ah, whoops.  I've only used wrappers around netfilter_queue in higher-level languages before and I think they made that info available

1547017676
testuser678
Thank you for pointing that out, it just clicked for me

@andrewrk is connectfree.co.jp hiring zig programmers? the website redirect to home page, and shows nothing

1547032743
kristate
red_freeman: yes, we are hiring

1547033850
redfreeman
kristateï¼š do you have a jd or something?

1547033898
kristate
jd = job description?

1547033912
redfreeman
yes,sir

1547034044
kristate
we can take the conversation off irc if you are serious, but mainly supporting the language. We have a number of internal projects that are written in Zig and keeping Zig healthy is very important

1547034065
kristate
I want to make sure that key developers are well paid

1547034156
redfreeman
yes, I am interested,

1547034171
kristate
cool, please shoot me an email: kt@connectfree.co.jp  thanks

Is `zig fmt` not available on master?  Or is it part of the self-hosted compiler (zig2?)

1547067575
andrewrk
testuser678, the latter - it's part of self-hosted only at the moment

1547067633
testuser678
How far along is the self-hosted compiler?  Is it viable to switch over for a side project or does it still have many rough edges

1547067917
andrewrk
it's not viable at all, you can't use it for anything but `zig fmt`

1547067950
testuser678
andrewrk: cool, thanks

1547067954
andrewrk
there are some core language features to nail down before progressing further on self-hosted, I think

1547067961
testuser678
makes sense

1547067984
testuser678
Is the community mostly on here and github?

1547067992
andrewrk
as is, the self-hosted compiler was a test bed for async/await/coroutines features of the language. it served that purpose very well as I am now rewriting that aspect of zig with new knowledge
