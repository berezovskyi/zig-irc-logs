Hejsil and I are working on Zig live here:

donpdonp
anyone used zig's webasm target?

1548444169
donpdonp
im trying to build a simple hello world but the resulting .wasm (when decompiled to wast) has just one function - (func $panic (type $0)

1548444180
donpdonp
though the .zig file has pub fn hello()

1548444718
kristate
try exporting it

1548444726
kristate
donpdonp: try exporting it

1548444785
kristate
donpdonp:

1548444916
donpdonp
i swear i tried that before. just tried again and hey something is in the .wast.

1548444918
donpdonp
thx kristate

1548444970
kristate
donpdonp: you're welcome donpdonp

1548444987
kristate
donpdonp: we're hacking on zig/zen right now on twitch

1548444998
donpdonp
ha.

1548445002
donpdonp
i'll take a look.

1548445040
donpdonp
are you the one eating pizza?

1548445467
kristate
donpdonp: yes :-)

1548445508
donpdonp
export fn xzoomret() [8]u8 {} ; zig build-lib --strip --target-arch wasm32 => TODO implement C ABI for this architecture. See

1548445527
donpdonp
export fn xzoomret() u8 {}; works fine for a simpler return value. that was the difference.

1548445563
kristate
donpdonp: okay, I will implement it

1548445566
donpdonp
is there a way to return a string value without hitting this missing feature?

1548445638
Flaminator
If I pass a struct to a function by value at what point does Zig decide to pass it by reference instead?

1548445767
Hejsil
Flaminator, It's an optimization, so there is no clear semantic for it

1548445798
Hejsil
Right now, Zig always pass structs by ref behind your back

1548445801
Hejsil
I think

1548445912
kristate
donpdonp: the calling convention for export is c abi, so you must return a c_abi objectg

1548445948
kristate
donpdonp:

1548446093
donpdonp
so []u8 is the right type to return in this case?

1548446185
kristate
[*]u8

1548446219
Flaminator
Yeah just noticed that just can't change things on a struct you passed to a function by value because it's constant. So need to create a copy of it in the function itself.

1548446297
donpdonp
wow! i see a string in the wast.

1548446302
Hejsil
Yep, or pass it by mutable pointer :)

1548446365
donpdonp
export fn xzoomret() [*]const u8 { return c"zig main"; } => (data $3 (i32.const 8) "zig main\00") (func $xzoomret (type $1) ... return 8)

1548446384
donpdonp
where 8 is the offset into the webabm block-of-ram.

1548446391
donpdonp
way cool.

1548446404
donpdonp
webabm/webasm

1548446959
kristate
donpdonp: cool

1548455058
JinShil
Hello.  Can anyone tell me where in the source code comptime expressions are executed?  Is there a JIT, VM, how (in general) does it work?

1548455343
kristate
JinShil: think of it like mapreduce

1548455383
kristate
we are maping instructions to ZigIR and then from ZigIR reducing down to constants or actual LLVM IR

1548455447
kristate
heavy lifting is done in src/ir.cpp

1548455547
JinShil
kristate, Thanks.  I see several `ir_eval*` and `eval` implementations in ir.cpp.  I suspect that's where magic is.

1548455651
kristate
no magic, just love and code

1548455670
JinShil
:)

1548455699
kristate
JinShil: oh, and a ton of switch statements

1548455819
halosghost
mmmmm switch statements
