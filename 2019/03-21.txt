diltsman, it's live on the download page now

andrewrk: congrats :)

1553133648
daurnimator
now crunch time on the bugs until april 8 I guess?

1553133718
daurnimator
(also huzzah.... now I can't build git HEAD because my distro doesn't have llvm 8 yet)

1553133952
andrewrk
there's always

1553134006
andrewrk
yeah crunch time on bugs and minor ergonomics until april 8

1553134073
andrewrk
then I really really want to get no-copy semantics done and the coroutine rewrite done

1553134083
andrewrk
those items are holding so many things back

1553134220
scientes
yes

1553134568
diltsman
Yay!

1553134633
daurnimator
oh hey; zig got a mention in the llvm release notes!

1553134669
andrewrk
yep, I've been doing that for every release. helps to get a little publicity

1553134859
andrewrk
if anyone wants to contribute to zig indirectly by contributing to SourceHut, here's an issue that is blocking FreeBSD from being on the download page:

1553135934
andrewrk
wow, I mentioned this is #sr.ht and ddevault already fixed it

1553138808
andrewrk
who thinks my add-freebsd-to-the-download-page ci changes are going to work first try?

1553174484
adam12
CI branches with a million "Try this" commits are my favourite. Also, excited to try the FreeBSD release.

1553189415
andrewrk
freebsd builds are up on ziglang.org/download

1553189677
euantor
awesome!

1553189732

I wonder why the Linux build seems to be working out at 5MiB bigger than FreeBSD and 2MiB bigger than macOS?

gunnarahlberg
hi! I understand that I made a misstake here. But, I'd like to discuss the ergonomics of the error message

1553193431
gunnarahlberg
how do I share some code?

1553193493
gunnarahlberg


1553193592
gunnarahlberg
and

1553193639
gunnarahlberg
source code inline is not working the way I expected it to. First of, I'm running this in alpine linux and the error message says: error: type 'std.os.WindowsGetStdHandleErrs!std.os.file.File' does not support field access

1553193648
gunnarahlberg
why "windows"?

1553193669
gunnarahlberg
and second question, can I do source inline?

1553193741
andrewrk
gunnarahlberg, see

1553193802
andrewrk
the only possible way getStdOut() can return an error is on windows, which is why the error set is named after windows

1553193822
andrewrk
std.io.getStdOut is a cross platform abstraction, so that's why you still have to care about windows error codes

1553193833
andrewrk
what is source inline?

1553193853
andrewrk
this?

1553194458
andrewrk
gunnarahlberg, also I just filed this issue related to alpine linux:

1553194669
gunnarahlberg
andrewrk: Yay, thank you!

1553194698
gunnarahlberg
I'm terrible at finding an existing bug report when I find a bug. I'll try harder to parse the existing bug reports next time

1553194711
strmpnk
I was just checking out some of that io code on windows. It seems like outStream isn't defined on File on windows.

1553194742
strmpnk
write will work but `var out = &stdout.outStream().stream;` fails to build (works on linux fine).

1553194756
strmpnk
I can file an issue but I'm not sure if this is user error or already known?

1553194839
andrewrk
strmpnk, I just tried this and it works fine on windows

1553194869
andrewrk
where are you getting this information from? os.File.outStream is not conditionally defined, there's no way it could be unavailable on windows

1553194874
andrewrk
maybe you have a different zig version installed

1553194875
strmpnk
Hmm. Maybe I'll try a smaller source file but 0.3.0+b7fb63d6 is failing for me.

1553194920
strmpnk
And yeah, I was reading and wondered why it was failing.

1553194949
strmpnk
I'm guessing I've done something wrong elsewhere. Going to pull the said lines out and try a small sample.

1553195030
strmpnk
Ah. Indeed. Looks like there was a shim that scoop put in place that was still in my path for some reason.

1553195046
strmpnk
Thanks for the quick PEBCAK debugging.

1553195146
scientes
has it be discussed how asm goto will be used?

1553195153
scientes
static branching in llvm-8

1553195154
strmpnk
And it looks like order isn't fixing it. I bet I have to log out, which is why it confused me.

1553195180
scientes
could a labeled block use a variable that could be higher in scope

1553195198
scientes
so that we could run a buildin like @enableStaticBranch(:foo) on it?

1553195305

I'm about to start live coding more of the general purpose debug allocator:

argh need to create a twitch account, nice mem leak detection!
