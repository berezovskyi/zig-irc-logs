andrewrk: rpmalloc is a little similar to the pooling allocator I wrote. I don't see a reason it has to have a limit of <= 32 byte alignment. In fact the way the allocator works requires it to allocate spans that are at least 64kb aligned, which is why I added > page size alignment to DirectAllocator for linux.

how would this work with

simpler example

emekankurumeh[m], this is how I was thinking it would work

thoughts?

Akuli, thank you for the bug report

how do i create a struct with a member that can be of any type? i thought about making a function that takes the type as an argument and returns a struct, but i don't want to treat my structs differently depending on which type they have

1549223305
andrewrk
Akuli, you cannot do that in zig. each struct field must have a specific type and it cannot change

1549223373
Akuli
is there some way to have an "any type whatever" object then? i'm trying to implement an interpreter for a dynamic programming language that has values of different types, and the value struct needs to contain different data depending on the type

oooo the docs are online too, nice

doesn't this mean that if i define the struct of the language's objects in one file, and it uses some union, that union must contain all the possible types that the object's data can be? so the file that defines the object struct must know about all the types that the language has?

1549223569
Akuli
now that i think about it more, it's not actually a problem because the interpreter doesn't have some kind of api whose users could define types with their own kinds of data

1549223582
Akuli
should have thought more about unioning before trying to avoid it :D

do we have an official docker image?

1549227408
Akuli
idea: a cross-platform function that returns the executable in the stdlib (if it doesn't exist yet)

1549228136
andrewrk
emekankurumeh[m], what would be the purpose of the docker image?

1549228185
andrewrk
Akuli, we have std.os.openSelfExe, std.os.selfExePath, and std.os.selfExeDirPath

I'm trying to read a file that is exactly 100MB, this runs into StreamTooLong error: const contents = try st.readAllAlloc(allocator, 1000 * 1000 * 100);

1549235284
schme245
but if I add 1, it works

schme245
what is that last byte?

maybe it pads with EOF?
