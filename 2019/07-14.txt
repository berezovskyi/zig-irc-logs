I kinda like @cast, because it simplifies the grammar

1563062414
scientes
in #1757

1563062546
hryx
same here, I like @cast. I think the thing holding it back (if I remember) is seeing it in action in real code, e.g. the standard library

1563064550
andrewrk
hryx, how about @as ? same thing, just 2 fewer characters

1563064649
hryx
I'm down with @as

1563064659
scientes
m2

1563064664
hryx
I do like me some fewer characters

1563064751
hryx
actually it's nice avoiding the word "cast" because C folks may assume you can do lossy conversion with it

oh wow buster was released

1563065040
emekankurumeh[m]
what's buster?

1563065051
scientes
Debian 10

1563065106
emekankurumeh[m]
i would prefer an infix style cast but, @as is fine

1563065528
Tetralux
Try saying that five times fast... at-as

1563065655
emekankurumeh[m]
how hard would implenting @reify be?

1563065987
emekankurumeh[m]
i'm considering doing a poc implementation to explore some ideas in zig

1563066076
hryx
having @reify would be truly epic. I would play with implementing codegen-less Protobuf compilation :D

1563066189
emekankurumeh[m]
with @reify I think distinct types could be done in userland

1563066251

oh my god I can do `zig translate-c windows.h -target x86_64-windows --library c` on linux now

1563066366
emekankurumeh[m]
I kinda wish translate c output wasn't so "busy"

1563066729
emekankurumeh[m]
like if I include windows.h I get thousands of lines of unrelated definitions

1563067414

is there a function in std to parse a string to a number?

1563067527
emekankurumeh[m]
std.fmt.parseInt

1563067627

thank you

fgenesis: I just tested on an instance of irssi and I don't get a notification for it. I think it might be somethign you've configured?

1563077427
fgenesis
last time i've touched that config was 10 years ago :B

1563077443
fgenesis
i don't think so but whatev, don't mind me

1563077492
daurnimator
fgenesis: could you list your highlights?

1563077505
fgenesis
hat do you mean

1563077507
fgenesis
*what

1563077820
daurnimator
fgenesis: what is the output of `/hilight`

1563077839

daurnimator: just my nick, nothing else

1563077871
fgenesis
and it's not an

1563079072

fgenesis: what is your `beep_msg_level`?

1563079728

hryx: indeed @reigy would be awesome for things like protobuf

andrewrk: I'm happy with @as

why does the bot send the link title as a notification instead of a standard message anyway

1563085494
torque
(and why does it prepend the nick of the person who linked it)

1563087421
nrdmn
good morning! is someone here working with uefi?

1563090824
daurnimator
torque: 1. because someone (in another channel) asked for it to be a notification so that it wouldn't stand out as much. 2. so that you know who's link it was (can get confusing if two people send a link at once).

1563090868
torque
that's weird because in general notifications stand out more imo

1563090885
daurnimator
seems to depend on client

1563128333
ntgg
i'm getting a weird issue, explained with the relevant code here:

1563128334
[[]]
n​tgg: Title "show" Shortened <

1563128353
ntgg
essentially it's only running part of a block of code, sometimes

1563128375
ntgg
there is also a chance there is something wrong with my logic, but I can't figure out what that would be

1563128446
ntgg
also line 25 should have a ';' at the end

1563128702
Tetralux
Wait - the for loop should have a ';' after it??

1563128946
emekankurumeh[m]
no?

1563128969
Tetralux
I mean - that's what on L25 no?

1563129005
Tetralux
Well no - it's the if right

1563129006
Tetralux
But still

1563129013
Tetralux
Still shouldn't need it.

1563129688
ntgg
If I don't have it there is a compiler error

1563129695
ntgg
compile error

1563129796
Tetralux
That seems wrong.

1563129845
ntgg
It's because i'm doing `for (..) thing;`

1563129855
ntgg
not `for (..) { thing; }`

1563129910
ntgg
the thing is just the if statement

1563130135
Tetralux
that sounds like a bug report to me xD

1563130177
Tetralux
to me, thats no different than the seicolon here: for (...) {};

1563130763
ntgg
Here's the full code if someone wants to look through it to help me figure out the issue:

1563130764
[[]]
n​tgg: Title "~ntgg/snake-zig - sourcehut git" Shortened <

1563130828
ntgg
The relevant code would be in main.zig and game_state.zig

1563131181
via
i don't feel like EAGAIN should be unreachable in write(). aside from the possibility of nonblocking being set on it, it sometimes happens without that. it seems to be reproducable by just pegging stderr with writes

1563131188
via
if it returned an error, i could just deal with it

1563131383
ntgg
by the way, figured out the issue

1563131438
ntgg
I needed to return State {.Playing = PlayingState.init(..) } instead of just the PlayingState.init(..);

1563131449
ntgg
this seems like a compiler bug, especially since it worked sometimes

1563139768
emekankurumeh[m]
`zig fmt` is randomly truncating my files

1563140065
emekankurumeh[m]
i found the issue: i had `async pub` instead of `pub async` i don't think that should cause zig fmt to delete my entire file

1563140414
Tetralux
That.. seems like the exact reason I don't use fmt tools xD

1563140616
emekankurumeh[m]
andrewrk: is SegmentedList thread-safe?

1563142142
hspak
is there a way to convert [4]u8 to a u32?

1563142205
Tetralux
Maybe mem.readInt and friends?

1563142273
hspak
I'll try that, thanks

1563142369
Tetralux
Specifically: const v = mem.readIntNative(u32, array);

1563142392
Tetralux
There's also writeIntNative for the opposite operation.

1563142493
hspak
I'm seeing > expected type '*const [4]u8', found '[]u8' -- do I need another cast op to make it happy? I'm passing in a slice, e.g foo[1..5]

1563142544
emekankurumeh[m]
try mem.readIntSlice

1563142546
Tetralux
If you have a slice, there's: mem.readIntSliceNative(type, slice) T

1563142571
Tetralux
It asserts you have at least the number of bytes needed at runtime.

1563142631
hspak
woot, that worked, thanks Tetralux
