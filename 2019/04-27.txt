andrewrk: Master is broken

1556326896
andrewrk
shritesh, oops, thanks

1556326919
andrewrk
I ran the tests and then made a minor change with that breakage

1556326987
shritesh
The tests run much faster with your latest change.

1556327015
andrewrk
the zig fmt thing? that's kind of surprising

1556327047
shritesh
Or maybe the builds are just cached.

1556327062
andrewrk
it moves the compilation of zig fmt from first run to during `make`

1556327584
shritesh
ah

emekankurumeh[m]
does zig emit compiler errors if you try to link a library that it can't find? or does it assume that the library will be dynamically loaded?

1556335248
emekankurumeh[m]
also zig doesn't build libc from source on freebsd so does it need to link crtbegin.o and friends?

1556335298
daurnimator
emekankurumeh[m]: yes. on freebsd there is no stable syscall ABI: you must link against libc

1556335314
daurnimator
linux is the only widely in use platform that actually has a stable syscall AB

1556335317
daurnimator
+I

emekankurumeh[m]
i thought so but i wasn't sure

1556337034
daurnimator
How can I get an empty error set?

1556337128
daurnimator
I'm trying to do: `const NoErrorOutStream = std.io.OutStream(EmptyErrorSet);`

1556337477
daurnimator
ah! error{}

have you guys seen:

I know andrew's fielded questions about it in stream Q&As, he said he won't care about it until it's not vaporware

1556344238
daurnimator
emekankurumeh[m]: that's a very common question. search around for zig and vlang :P

1556344281
daurnimator
emekankurumeh[m]:

1556345684
emekankurumeh[m]
do we have zig benchmarks for things like parser speed or compilation speed?

1556345705
emekankurumeh[m]
preferably for the self-hosted compiler.

I have never seen someone tease "soon to release" source code for software before, what an extremely bizarre thing

1556346672
tyler569
it seems to be a bit of a trend in system programming languages these days unfortunately

1556346682
tyler569
v and Jon Blow's jai are in very similar situations

1556347116
torque
I haven't really been following Jai's development but to my knowledge it's more or less a hobby project with no real promises or set schedule. At the very least he hasn't made like 5 different github repos saying "will open source soon" which is I think the weirder part for me

1556349262

torque: I have...

andrewrk, I figured out my issue with linking. my working directory had leftovers from a previous compilation, especially kernel32.lib, which was probably then found by lld. removing it fixed the build

1556369586
Sahnvour
I guess it should avoid looking in the cwd if possible, you never know what's there

1556377991
andrewrk
Sahnvour, aha. I actually have experienced that problem before. I think it might be worth considering how we can prevent that accident

1556378080
andrewrk
I agree we should definitely make it stop looking in the cwd if possible

How would I do a nested for in Zig?  For example, in C I would use "for (int i = 0; i < WIDTH; i++) { for (int j = 0; j < HEIGHT; j++) { ..."

1556380466
ysgard
I thought using a nested while would work, but strangely the outer loop never increments

1556380835
ysgard
Like this seems like it would work:

1556380878
ysgard
The documentation describes a for but it looks like it's for iterating over collections

1556382215
tgschultz
ysgard, nested while should work: var i = usize(0); while(i < end):(i += 1) { var j = usize(0); while(j < inner_end):(j += 1) {//do stuff} }

1556382299
tgschultz
your gist won't work because j is never reset to 0

1556382315
tgschultz
so the inner loop only runs once

1556382397
tgschultz
see:

ysgard
Ah, I see!  Thanks tgschultz!

So my zigfmt WASM binary is 837K (197K compressed) in debug mode, 899K (145K compressed) with --release-small, 921K (144K compressed) with --release-safe and 788K (131K compressed) with --release-fast.

Here's zig fmt running on the web.

so my browser is doing the format? excellent!
