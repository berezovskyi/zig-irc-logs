hryx, never mind - I see that not only does it not parse in the stage1 parser, it also doesn't pass zig-spec grammar

_whitelogger, welcome back

hryx
andrewrk: thanks for confirming

1557247428

zig-spec should be the authority - if zig-spec is wrong we should fix it

hryx, for comparing perf of different implementations, you can measure bytes per second of the different implementation, and then try a bunch of different workloads - for example the entire standard library

1557247758
andrewrk
for looking at perf analysis of a particular implementation, I recommend valgrind + kcachegrind

is there a kind soul running a windows machine that's willing to get me a stack-trace for #2440 ?

1557247774
andrewrk
TheLemonMan, just a sec

1557247844
hryx
I'll give those analysis tools a shot tonight!

1557247979
andrewrk
I'm sure there's a better way to learn these tools but I did a video on using valgrind + kcachegrind:

1557248009
andrewrk
it definitely doesn't take 1hr42min to learn if you can find a text based tutorial

1557248263

TheLemonMan, it's failing on `bin\zig.exe fmt ..\build.zig`. But running that process alone isn't reproducing the failure so it's hard to get a stack trace

1557248280
andrewrk
it crashes when that is executed as a child process

1557248314
TheLemonMan
maybe windows doesn't like my stack probe routine :\

1557248381
andrewrk
I thought windows already had stack probing?

1557248386
andrewrk
before

1557248390
andrewrk
before #2440

1557248491
TheLemonMan
yep, but LLVM now uses __zig_stack_probe on windows too

hi SamTebbs33 - one thing you could do is to start a project targeting ARM. this will inevitably lead you to find the areas that need to be improved

1557248707
andrewrk
if you are interested in getting ARM 64 bit linux to be tier 1 support, I can open an issue and make a checklist for you

1557248811
TheLemonMan
I have a nearly-finished patchset for ARM 32 bit

1557249299
TheLemonMan
andrewrk, any reason why naked functions are not callable?

1557249339
andrewrk
TheLemonMan, yeah - the idea is you have to @ptrCast the naked function to an actual calling convention

1557249412
TheLemonMan
I'm not 100% on-board with conflating nakedness with the calling convention

1557249452
TheLemonMan
but gotcha, I'd suggest to relax the restriction for functions with no arguments and void return type

1557249473
andrewrk
SamTebbs33,

1557249522
andrewrk
TheLemonMan, makes sense. I'm open to proposals

1557249615
andrewrk
alright I'm going to be quiet for a few hours and make some progress on copy elision

1557255386
tgschultz
I think there's a bug with comptime @ptrCast where writing through the cast changes the child type permanently.

is there a build.zig command to add -rdynamic

Thalheim: I'm not sure how naked
