a thought on enum ranges and @enumToInt

The story with C++20 coroutines:

1551494288
shachaf
They ended up with a version that requires heap allocation (?) because implementing the version without heap allocation, which in theory should be backwards compatible (?), would involve complicated optimizations (?) that no compiler knows how to implement (?), and also they ran out of time so they won't include any library support (?)

are c++20 coroutines symmetric or asymmetric?

"#include <math.h>", zig translate-c file.h, error: 'math.h' file not found. Ubuntu 18.10 here, hopefully not borked.

I checked out a random commit from 4 days ago "fix incorrectly trying to memset at comptime", at that point zig translate-c still worked, but the c ptr issue is still there

andrewrk: It seems optional C pointers never worked. You're missing a test :)

1551532875
gamester
andrewrk: This commit breaks zig translate-c for me (it can't find c stdlib headers)

1551533043
andrewrk
gamester, try with `--library c` ?

1551533043
gamester
andrewrk: then I get "error: 'bits/libc-header-start.h' file not found"

1551533080
gamester
isn't programming fun?

1551533090
gamester
:)

1551533143
andrewrk
what version are you on?

1551533169
gamester
oh I'm now on the version that broke the translate-c, I'll go to most recent now

1551533180
andrewrk
I'm pretty sure I fixed that

1551533207
gamester
The #include <math.h> error was on the most recent version

1551533227
andrewrk
with --library c?

1551533231
gamester
no

1551533266
andrewrk
libc will probably be available by default once

1551533293
andrewrk
zig's C compilation facilities are isolated from the rest of the system

1551533334
gamester
ok so "zig translate-c file.h" is supposed to fail if file.h includes a c standard library, unless you do --library c?

1551533334
andrewrk
it might seem annoying at first, but then you don't get any users filing bug reports

1551533340
andrewrk
yes that's correct

1551533354
gamester
okay

1551533383
andrewrk
it will probably work without that once

1551534107
andrewrk
gamester, did it work with latest version and --library c?

1551534463
gamester
yes

andrewrk, updated zig ver c4887d7f. This is the cmd that I used to get zigmain.o zig build-obj -isystem ../../include/ -isystem /usr/lib/arm-none-eabi/include -isystem /usr/lib/arm-none-eabi -target armv7-freestanding-gnueabihf zigmain.zig

develonepi3, looks good

Since Zig is a C compiler now, I think it may be a good idea to sometimes interface with C code using more C code and interfacing with that instead, at least for now and when the C code uses varargs. C code can be such awful nonsense.

what?

1551547876
scientes
when did zig become a C compiler?

andrewrk, ultibo now calls zig

1551555562
andrewrk
develonepi3, what is this we're looking at?

1551555650

andrewrk, I created a kernel7.img which I ran on RRi2 see

andrewrk, Only need 4 files kernel7.img bootcode.bin fixup_x.dat start.elf you tftp & telnet to the system running ultibo

1551556081

yep:

1551556097

andrewrk, I create zigmain.o on Ubuntu and used fpc with Lararus on RPi3B+
