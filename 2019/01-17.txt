I expect to be able to push the Stream portion of interface reform when I wake up tomorrow morning (running what should be final integration tests now). That just leaves Random, which tiehuis said he already did.

There was a little bit of annoyance from the Abstract interfaces requiring a *@OpaqueType, because some implementations didn't need to be a pointer and a couple were 0-bit types which I had to add a dummy field to.

Of course, they needed an interface struct member before, so I guess nothing was really lost there.

Is godbolt broken for anyone else? Seems to insist on inserting \r\n newlines.

Oh, I see that issue was reported 2 days ago

Is a inline for loop always run at compile time?

Or can I call runtime functions inside of it?

MajorLag
you can call runtime functions inside it, but whatever it is iterating over must be comptime known.

Alright, so then my loop just gets unrolled into multiple calls, which are populated with the comptime values from the iteration?

yes

Is there any plan on supporting information being carried with an error?

Currently I'm using std.debug.warn to print some text and then return an error

andrewrk, I have a question when you have time. Given this simplified gist:

p being passed as an actual copy at some point in the future?

MajorLag, I think your code isn't being analyzed because it's not being called. lazy top level declaration evaluation

andrewrk, it is being analyzed, I have it called by parts of std and passing a full integration test. I think I'm just getting lucky because passing a struct as a parameter currently means it is always passed as a pointer (IIRC), but that will change in the future and the compiler could choose to pass it as a copy and break it.

andrewrk
that's correct
