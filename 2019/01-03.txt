do we have computed goto's in zig?

emekoi, no

will consider adding them if we can't get switch statements optimizing into equivalent performance

andrewrk: is there a way to output --verbose-ir only for the file I am compiling and not the builtins/std functions? I know in D there was a way to exclude the stdlib

I guess that last question is open for anyone! :)

wilsonk, no, there's not. here's a clue though:

exporting and overriding the panic handler works very well...thanks! :)

I get 4.1k output with both tricks, 219k if I just import debug.warn (and use it, of course) and 4.7M if I don't use the panic override!! Wow

wilsonk, what about in --release-fast or --release-small mode?

1546490055
andrewrk
a large portion of the size is stack traces

1546490098
andrewrk
which I believe are not included in release fast / release small modes

1546490261
wilsonk
3.8k, 201k and 4.3M for release-fast and release-small

1546490316
andrewrk
which one is which?

I assume that is for "both tricks" vs "debug.warn" vs "no panic override"

1546491085
wilsonk
yes daurnimator has it correct...the sizes don't change between fast/small modes strangely

1546491310
andrewrk
that's not surprising - but it would be surprising if the size didn't change between debug and release (non-safe)
