I just googled that to see what you'd get and saw no useful results. so here's the project's homepage:

hello :) is there a way add arbitrary linker flags?

1559389869
pellsson
to add*

andrewrk: why is `@typeOf(&slice[item])` `[*]Type` instead of `*Type`? These are not C types, taking a pointer to a single item should be a single item pointer right??

1559405206
tgschultz
oh, nevermind. My blood sugar must be low, I completely misread this error for the past 10 minutes. I guess I should eat lunch.

andrewrk: i had a zig section of my webassembly talk at gocon!

1559430487
scientes
hahahahaha

1559430491
scientes
invader!

1559430518
scientes
not that they really compete, go has a gc

1559430598
Xe
scientes: i even called out Zig's brevity :D

1559431440
emekankurumeh[m]
i hope you said all good things ;)

1559431518
Xe
oh i did

recording is pending, i'm still waiting for it too

1559431739

I saw those notes but I don't understand the motivation at all.

1559431774
scientes
shachaf, its web people

1559431787
scientes
they get excited about old technology, anyways, I'm not trying to be critical

1559431788
Xe
shachaf: okay so i'm tired of relying on intel

1559431793
shachaf
It says it "makes hardware less relevant" and "removes the OS from the equation". But the hardware is still relevant and the OS is still in the equation.

1559431814
Xe
i want to make it easier to get off the amd64 train

1559431815
shachaf
It's just hidden behind the WebAssembly interpreter instead of a cross-compiler target or a library.

1559431825
Xe
well no shit, pardon my french

1559431844
Xe
this just removes the linux abi and the amd64 bytecode requirement from the stack

1559431854
scientes
but it doesn't

1559431854
Xe
effectively i want to do a lot of the stuff IBM did with i

1559431887
scientes
why not just use Java(tm)?

1559431891
Xe
that means oracle

1559431893
shachaf
But what's the benefit over a platform abstraction library and a cross-compiler?

1559431896
scientes
that is what Java was all about

1559431906
Xe
also

1559431911
Xe
i want to get in at the ground floor of this

1559431939
scientes
but no-one is going to write web-assembly, why would they?

1559431960
Xe
a friend of mine is working on a native binary -> wasm transpiler

1559432018
Xe
i don't expect you all to understand my interest in this stuff, this is stuff i really get excited about though

1559432022
scientes
Intel doesn't really implement the x86 instruction set either

1559432033
scientes
they just translate into a secret internal instruction set

1559432115
shachaf
scientes: You're being a little hostile here. I suggest that it doesn't help.

1559432129
scientes
sorry

1559432131
Xe
i mean yeah i realize i'm reinventing the concept of a JVM

1559432142
scientes
WebASM will certainly succeed

1559432145
scientes
it already has

1559432152
scientes
I'm just not excited about

1559432159
Xe
worst case i end up becoming an expert in a field that basically nobody understands

1559432164
Xe
the horror ya know lol

1559432264
shachaf
Well, the JVM is obviously not suitable for a lot of things.

1559432284
Xe
i'm not hoping to make a magic bullet

1559432289
scientes
yeah it really can't be compared

1559432302
Xe
i just wanna do cool stuff with computers lol

1559432328
scientes
I forget his name, but I was at the LLVM conference and asked a guy about what he thought about emscripten, and he just said it was another platform

1559432333
scientes
and I think that is the right attitude

1559432370
shachaf
It's an easy argument that this is better than the JVM for sending programs to web browsers.

1559432371
scientes
as the emscripten mozilla guys were giving a presentation there

1559432383
scientes
its also better than asm.js

1559432395
shachaf
But it's not clear to me how it helps on the server.

1559432396
scientes
which was the whole point

1559432409
Xe
half the reason i wanna do it on the server is to just see what it's like

1559432495
scientes
I also get the reason of trying to reduce the complexity that you are exposed to

1559432531
Xe
i'd like to try replacing ioctl() with a concept i'm calling "control streams"

1559432538
Xe
where you put stringly typed key=value pairs

1559432582
Xe
i honestly don't expect to get anywhere significant with this, i don't expect to become the next steve gates, i just wanna try stuff and see what it's like

1559432593
Xe
worst case i learn how to

1559432617
Xe
i'm a hobbyist coder turned professional tbh

1559432622
scientes
there is certainly a problem with low level stuff that there is so much going on

1559432633
scientes
its hard to know what to pay attention to

1559432692
Xe
i've gotten pretty far with just 5 system calls

1559432702
Xe
open/close/read/write/flush

1559432716
Xe
gonna probably add a clock and a yield or something

1559432724
scientes
yield?

1559432728
scientes
you mean sched()?

1559432741
Xe
or something, i'm not entirely sure yet

1559432752
scientes
ahh sched_yield() haha

1559432788
Xe
the main thing i'm playing with is the idea i'm calling "plan 9 taken three steps farther"

1559432793
Xe
everything's a stream

1559432806
scientes
oh geeze, will firefox now have a debugger where you can stop and step and read the registers?

1559432821
Xe
i'd like to do crazy stuff like transactional computing

1559432825
Xe
or like

1559432826
scientes
pretty soon Knuth will have to abandon the MMIX and replace it with webASM

1559432836
Xe
try to parse json and if you fail, uncompute the parsing, bail and fail

1559432849
Xe
then you can send implications to other parts of the stack to fail the transaction

1559432856
Xe
automatically

1559432859
Xe
without you having to care
