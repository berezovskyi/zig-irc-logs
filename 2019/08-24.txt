Anyone in for a day of pairing?

i notice that I can't call c functions in comptime areas, any way around this?

1566617954
daurnimator
plumm: no... because the C functions only exist on the target. not on the build system

1566618130
plumm
ah, didnt know comptime was in the build system

1566618154
plumm
goot to know; by alternative i mean how do i emulate said functionality? im not a c programmer so i dont know the gotos

1566618434
plumm
I just need to initialize some global constant

1566618964
daurnimator
plumm: huh? when I meant "the build system" I meant on the machine that is doing the compilation

1566618975
daurnimator
plumm: initialise what to what?

1566619342
plumm
daurnimator: its mac os specific, basically the timing function returns the value in cpu ticks and we can call in (and cache) a steady_rate value from the kernel

1566619357
plumm
since the ticks might mean different slices of time, confusing i know

1566619376
daurnimator
plumm: you need to call it from e.g. an .init method. not at comptime

1566619397
plumm
hm, ok :)

also doesn't OSX have clock_gettime for like 4 years now?

1566619468
plumm
yes but thats limited to millisecond granilurity

1566619478
plumm
granularity

1566619500
plumm
mach_absolute_time has nanosecond granularity ("mach/mach_time.h")

1566619642
daurnimator
plumm: clock_gettime should have nanosecond granularity

1566619788
plumm
daurnimator: clock_gettime calls mach_absolute_time() internally

1566619797
daurnimator
yes

1566619847
plumm
I think   I avoid a call to the kernel using the steady factor and mach absolute time, but i will take your word for it

trying to track down a segfaul in analyze.cpp, in the function "resolve_llvm_types_union" I'm getting a case where tag_type is NULL...anyone have any idea if that is valid and/or if it should be handled?  Right now it's causing a segfault further down the callstack

marler8997
nevermind I think I got it...now I just need to write a regression test:

does anybody know how to bypass `error: import of file outside package path`?

I'm trying to import a file from the parent directory

1566658873

from command line or build.zig? command line use `--main-pkg-path`

RE interfaces, would they resolve to static calls?
