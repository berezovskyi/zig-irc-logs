hey everyone, I'm trying to create a C-compatible string to populate with a libcurl function call, but I can't get the type signature right https://pastebin.com/MbbQLrYJ

drewr!~drew@user/drewr
how should I be defining `host`?

1641614251
drewr!~drew@user/drewr
apparently this works: var host: [*c][*c]u8 = null;

andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
drewr, hint: never type [*c] into your keyboard

1641623373
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
that's for auto-translated code only

1641623421
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
if I can see how you defined `host` in that code snippet I could help more

What's the difference between addLibPath and addPackagePath  ? What's the difference between a lib and a package?

(in the context of zig build)

Hello, this works and gives me an array of mutable strings: https://paste.gg/p/anonymous/75d09a7da33f41d2b01aae0fb8f436f1 But how does this work for differently sized strings? How do I write it if the second string is `{ 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' }` instead in this array? All sizes I have are compile time known.

1641650303
terminalpusher!~terminalp@2a01:586:8e8d:1:a3ae:5aad:c134:21a5
do I need to have all strings be the same size for this to work?

1641651330
jcmoyer!~jcmoyer@user/jcmoyer
the problem is that you would have a heterogenous array where the first string is typed [2]u8 and the second string is [5]u8

1641651339
jcmoyer!~jcmoyer@user/jcmoyer
making all strings the same length would be one solution

1641651453
jcmoyer!~jcmoyer@user/jcmoyer
another solution would be to use an array of slices if you don't mind the indirection, something like https://pastebin.com/raw/GRRrXW07 - note that the slices need to point to mutable memory though

hi all

I am going to follow this tutorial https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/

but in zig :D

how would I run the tests in a specific file using `zig build test [...]` ? 

1641673130
Seng!~nick@hurtig.ninja
I remeber somewhere someone asked about using `zig test` vs. `zig build test. I've added a library using .addPackagePath, and I can build and run, but I can run my tests.

1641673144
Seng!~nick@hurtig.ninja
*run my tests using `zig test`

1641673365
Seng!~nick@hurtig.ninja
I have, btw, a standard build.zig file, and have called .addPackagePath under the b.addTest() and b.addExecutable() calls.

ikskuh!~xq@v43666.php-friends.de
"zig build test" will just invoke a step called "test"

1641673599
ikskuh!~xq@v43666.php-friends.de
this is created by calling b.step("test", â€¦)

1641673615
ikskuh!~xq@v43666.php-friends.de
if you now say "zig build test" that step is being made

1641673625
ikskuh!~xq@v43666.php-friends.de
to make this step, all dependencies must be run for this step

1641673655
ikskuh!~xq@v43666.php-friends.de
so your file also contains a "b.addTest(source)"

1641673691
ikskuh!~xq@v43666.php-friends.de
the step created with b.step somehow depends on the b.addTest result, which is just a convenient and configurable invocation of "zig test"

1641673691
Seng!~nick@hurtig.ninja
Indeed it does.

i've written an article about all of that :)

I'll spare you re-writing it all on IRC, and read your articles :)

1641673761
ikskuh!~xq@v43666.php-friends.de
it doesn't handle tests per se, but the zig build system is just invoking zig as you would do it on the command line

Boarders_!sid425905@id-425905.lymington.irccloud.com
I am using zig-mode in emacs but it is quite annoying as if I save and there is a parse error then I will lose focus as it pops up the error in a separate buffer

1641675876
Boarders_!sid425905@id-425905.lymington.irccloud.com
can I change this easily or is there a suggested workflow that makes it nicer?

1641676646
Seng!~nick@hurtig.ninja
use vim

1641676704
Seng!~nick@hurtig.ninja
I have no clue. But it being emacs I'd be puzzled if you couldn't change the behaviour :')

g-w1!g-w1@2600:3c03::f03c:92ff:fe2f:c92f
Boarders_: if you use lsp-mode with zls, I think it will show the error in-buffer

I think Zig just optimized me into success! I wrote to some stack memory in a function, and returned that memory. But it wasn't garbage at that point and my AoC soltion was correct.

1641684777
Seng!~nick@hurtig.ninja
Then I did part2, did things slightly diffrent, yet returned old stack memory and everything was written in elvish.

1641684818
Seng!~nick@hurtig.ninja
I keep forgetting that there are two kinds of memory unlike in C# that I'm used to ((:

1641684845
Seng!~nick@hurtig.ninja
(I know technically C# also works with heap and stack, but I, as a developer, doesn't have to think about it)
