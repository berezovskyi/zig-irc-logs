x-post for anyone using zigmod I also make an index @ https://aquila.red/ if you want to showcase your projects. site listings are self service and supports both github/gitea login atm

working on an auto ci integration for it too

site itself is a full stack app with no js required on the frontend made almost entirely in Zig (uses c integration for sqlite)

motiejus, I finished cherry picking into the 0.9.x branch. apart from the 3 issues left in the 0.9.1 milestone, that branch is essentially a release candidate right now

1643869792
motiejus!~motiejus@2001:470:69fc:105::38fb
Ack. I'll run the tests with bazel-zig-cc, thanks for the heads up

1643869970
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
no problem, and no rush. if you find any issues I'll be sure to address them before the tag

1643876338
motiejus!~motiejus@2001:470:69fc:105::38fb
do we have a prebuilt zig binary from the branch?

1643876368
motiejus!~motiejus@2001:470:69fc:105::38fb
i.e. 0.9.x branch

1643876591
nektro!~meg@75-164-170-164.ptld.qwest.net
yep https://ziglang.org/download/

motiejus: No, not until it is released.

Weird question, I've got a legacy C codebase that I've been trying to hunt down UB by using combinations of warnings, static analysis, UBSan, etc

1643898339
ravella!~ravella@user/ryanavella
I'm considering using Zig's c-translate and compiling in Debug mode to see if that might catch more issues. Has anyone tried anything like this?

1643903882
Piraty!~irc@user/piraty
ravella: last i heard that zig-to-c transpiler is not that great yet

1643903893
Piraty!~irc@user/piraty
i tried on some mid-sized oss projects

ravella you're talking about going the other direction (c-to-zig) right?

1643904916
motiejus!~motiejus@2001:470:69fc:105::38fb
andrewrk: do I have a deadline for testing 0.9.x? I'd like to add a couple of tests first, and that will take some time

1643905395
ravella!~ravella@user/ryanavella
Piraty : Does it work fine on "normal" C that avoids some of the weird edge cases of the language? Like e.g. if your code has function-scoped typedefs with side effects, it wouldn't surprise me if c-translate didn't handle that well

1643905454
ravella!~ravella@user/ryanavella
I tried running my codebase through c2rust and they didn't support some edge cases involving variadic functions (https://github.com/immunant/c2rust/issues/325)

1643905469
Piraty!~irc@user/piraty
tsmanner_: oh, i mixed it up indeed

1643905483
Piraty!~irc@user/piraty
ravella: seems you already know where the UB resides ;)

1643905595
ravella!~ravella@user/ryanavella
oh! I missed that too then. Yep, I know where the UB resides (gestures broadly at 300,000 lines of C in 5 different dialects)

1643906591
Piraty!~irc@user/piraty
sounds like openvpn to me ;)

motiejus, is 1 week enough time? 2 weeks?

1643916322
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
motiejus, yep we do have prebuilt zig binaries from the branch. look at the master branch URLs and just guess the URL for 0.9.0 based on swapping out the version

1643916368
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
ummm I take that back, I just checked and it looks like that mechanism is no longer in place (it used to make tarballs for all branches too)

1643916617
motiejus!~motiejus@2001:470:69fc:105::38fb
1 week should be more than enough. If you get the mechanism back, let me know. however by now I think I can make one myself otherwise

1643916649
motiejus!~motiejus@2001:470:69fc:105::38fb
I.e. make a release-looking tarball

first time watching a twitch stream. Is there a (special) subset of people who can comment, or am I dumb and can't find it (I am logged in)?

1643920655
motiejus!~motiejus@2001:470:69fc:105::38fb
I can see comments, but can't find an editable textarea nowhere around it :)

you probably need to be logged in

1643920704
companion_cube!~simon@user/companion-cube
*or* use the IRC bridge

motiejus: he's not live yet, you are probably watching a recording of a past stream

1643920714

(which might required login? not sure)

1643920734
motiejus!~motiejus@2001:470:69fc:105::38fb
haha, that may be the case

1643920746
