I'm currently reading the bits file of stage2 arches, and I see that there's no reference to floating point registers

Are those handled in other places, or is it simply not implemented yet for the time being?

is it common to use translate-c and get differing results? of course it may be a thing specific to the system i'm using, but I have low faith in that seeing as how c works just fine, it's gotta be something with zig

there is a problem with translate-c though, you have to modify the `ptrCast` in the main function to be a intToPtr/ptrToInt combo, for whatever reason changing function arguments with ptrCast doesn't work

I think my problem may be that clang does string interning and the class method "string" on NSString is referencing it
