ifreund, I have solved, in my head, how to do #131

I was thinking the lazy @alignOf() stuff you just pushed seemed related

Just discovered that a function called `exit` would be called by `std.os.exit`. Is it documented somewhere? Or is it a standard thing like `main` ?

If you're linking against the libc, it uses the exit function defined in the C standard.  Otherwise what it does depends on the platform.

bgiannan: I'm not quite sure what you mean? std.os.exit() make an exit syscall or the equivalent for the target platform

it doesn't call any user defined functions, unless you're doing the Bring Your Own OS thing

Do you guys think all the different executable formats and stuff will be staying in the stdlib? Things like ELF and DWARF and MachO?

noodlez: Yes, they're used by the Zig compiler

Awesome! Zig's stdlib and language features are starting to make it look perfect for writing a little kernel or other embedded whatever in

just watched a upcoming project select cmake as their build tool. cried a little

At least it can generate ninja builds

(Not a mark against make, but cmake's use of make is quite awful)
