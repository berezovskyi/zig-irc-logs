quick question: is it possible to do IO at comptime? For example, to parse some data file to initialize a data structure?

daurn!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
sm2n: in general, no.

1647407791
daurn!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
sm2n: the one thing you have those is `@embedFile` which lets you read an entire file as a string at comptime

1647407802
daurn!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
which might let you do what you're trying to do

If I create an EnumFieldStruct, is there any way to get that struct's field by an invariant of the enum without iterating over each struct field and checking if the string matches?

cot!~kiedtl@kisslinux/kiedtl
(Oh, and which enum invariant it is isn't comptime known)

Hi, I'm seeing a function named 'align()' in the std source code, and I'm wondering where I can find it's definition? I've tried grepping around and I can't find it. Is it a qualifier?

1647439933
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
vent: it's not a function, but rather part of the language's syntax yeah

1647439952
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
it's valid as a pointer attribute and on struct fields

1647439999
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
and variables, and functions too I believe

1647440055
vent!~user@185.201.0.197
Ahhh okay that explains why I can't find the definition then haha. So does it just modify the type's alignment?

1647440169
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
pretty much, alignment is part of the type system in zig

1647440213
ifreund!2940d10f8b@user/ifreund
i.e. @alignCast() and @ptrCast() are distinct

1647440232
vent!~user@185.201.0.197
Yeah I've noticed that when interopping with C

1647440309
vent!~user@185.201.0.197
Example that comes to mind is casting a *void to something else. I had to do something like @ptrCast(T, @alignCast(@alignOf(T), c_ptr))

1647441453
braewoods!~braewoods@user/braewoods
it probably is used for determining alignment of structs and allocated pointers

cot: check out FieldEnum https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/master/lib/std/meta.zig#L571 you should be able to use that with a switch on a runtime known value

andrewrk stream when?

has anyone used timer w/ async code? for whatever reason I get a super slow number with timer.read() after launching a bunch of tasks (that clearly take longer than the reported duration)

1647458776
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
haze, I don't think std.timer is integrated with evented I/O yet

1647458784
haze!~haze@user/haze
that would explain it

1647458793
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
e.g. if you sleep it just sleeps the kernel thread

1647458973
haze!~haze@user/haze
have you also witnessed arena allocator flipping out when used in async? it happens sparingly, but something in getAddressList w/r/t the arena allocator accesses something dangerous

1647460259
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
nope I am not aware of any arena allocator bugs

1647460745
haze!~haze@user/haze
I don't think its synchronized

why? maybe this is putting himself first
