Jonathan, watched your stream. As you probably observed, the cmph generation part is not well written written (especially the command-line tools), but I can write short guide on how to use it. The hashing part, which I care about, is quite robust: it does not allocate, and did about 7M hashes/sec on my laptop with my dataset.

on my end, I am getting quite close to where I would be able to use your work. It would be fun to make it run on windows. :)

motiejus that's awesome.  Some things work on windows already, but I'm a bit stuck now because Zig seems to be including some things it shouldn't.  Will need to push a fix to Zig
