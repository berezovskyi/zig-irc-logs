regular sort could be lowered to populate this for you automatically and use this under the hood

McKael, if you don't mind - could you file an issue for this use case if one does not already exist? would be nice to make sure we cover this use case before stabilizing the std lib

Building on Windows with the compiler dev kit and got undefined symbols for the f80 functions (extF80M_to_f64, etc) with zig.exe from the latest master tarball. What might I have wrong to cause this?

jaredmm, for some changes I think it's not possible to use an old dev kit anymore. I'll make a new version

Alright, thanks. I thought that might be the case..

It seems goto has been replaced by better break-statements and errdefer. Was it judged that goto is now not necessary anymore, or was it removed because it causes too much spaghetti code?

I remember being surprised that Golang actively kept goto

jemius, it's redundant with labeled break. discussion here: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/630
