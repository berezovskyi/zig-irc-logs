andrewrk: what's the issue with #131 in stage1?

1617160393
noam
but.... huh?

1617161092
noam
But... what dependency is there?? a.next depends on the

1617161102
noam
The value of b.next has no effect on a

1617161108
g-w1
thats why its a bug i think :P

1617161113
noam
Is that just a false dependency detection?

1617161120
g-w1
yea

how would I set the eval branch quota when I'm initializing a ComptimeStringMap?

1617166355
marler8997
here's the full code I'm trying to compile, just creating a comptime string map with 100 entries:

1617167194

marler8997, like this:

ah clever

Is this idiomatic zig?

1617204378
spacelove
Trying to work with ncurses, but this feels kind of funny

1617204487
ifreund
no it's not very idiomatic because ncurses is not an idiomatic zig library

1617204621
spacelove
Would you do it this way?

1617204721
ifreund
If I needed to use ncurses yes

1617204730
spacelove
Cool. J/w

1617204744
ifreund
though I'd probably get frustated and write my own terminal drawing library or work on an existing zig one

1617219371
andrewrk
ifreund, check it out:

1617219381
andrewrk
nice 'n clean

1617219564
ifreund
that is very clean, nice work :)

1617219641
andrewrk
if you remove the range case, it becomes very compact

1617219899
ifreund
andrewrk: are you planning on doing the switch validation functions in sema? I might give them a go if not

1617219917
ifreund
doesn't seem like there's a whole lot left to do on the branch in general

1617219922
andrewrk
that was going to be my next task, but I'm about to break for lunch. you want to go for it? :)

1617219960
andrewrk
Module.SrcLoc.byteOffset needs some work too

1617219977
andrewrk
also last I checked the cbe .h file test cases were failing for some reason

1617220025
g-w1
andrewrk: do you know why setevalbranchquota test is being reported failing on llvm12 tests?

1617220029
ifreund
hmm, maybe I'll look into the cbe test failures instead, I haven't done anything in sema yet

1617220049
andrewrk
g-w1, nope have not looked into it yet

1617220060
andrewrk
when was the last time you checked? I think I resolved an issue related to that a few days ago

1617220086
g-w1
the new pass manager pr mentioned it

1617220092
g-w1
havent compiled llvm12 yet :)

andrewrk, have a good one!

1617220205

how does zig std handle ioctl codes?

1617220224
mq32
i want to create portable zig code and i assume that ioctl codes differ between platforms?

1617221004
ifreund
ikskuh: I don't think it really does yet, but it should probably be done the same way as other info that differs between platforms/architectures

1617221019
ifreund
for now you can just @cImport() sys/ioctl.h

1617221110
ifreund
for example we do have SIOCGIFINDEX defined in std/os/bits/linux.zig

1617221409
ikskuh
ifreund: hm. i'd love to have no C deps in that project :/

1617221436
ifreund
ikskuh: You shouldn't need to link libc to include that header

1617221448
ikskuh
hm, i'll see :)

1617221455
ifreund
though you may manually need to tell zig where to look if you don't

1617221458
ikskuh
(building a DRM binding for zig)

1617232691
andrewrk
finally, got switch expressions passing tests in zir-memory-layout

1617232735
andrewrk
might even get the branch done today

1617232766
andrewrk
ifreund, you got anything WIP for me to watch out for?

1617234995
g-w1
seems like emit-h needs some work?

1617235199
g-w1
seems like it is literally trying to return void. ill look into why retvoid is not being used :1:8: error: TODO: C backend: implement value Void
