viric: oh, nice. i don't use system packages, but just the tar build from the website

slowjo!~slowjo@sourcehut/user/slowjo
even in debug mode the compiler (or is it the linker in the end?) throws out any code and optimizes out values that aren't used

1638197500
slowjo!~slowjo@sourcehut/user/slowjo
is it somehow possible to turn this off, so that i could use those e.g. from a debugger?

1638197648
slowjo!~slowjo@sourcehut/user/slowjo
the debugger already knows about the symbols i want to use (it can autocomplete them for me), but when wanting to use them it just says 'value has been optimized out'

slowjo: it shouldn't. how are you compiling?

1638198097
slowjo!~slowjo@sourcehut/user/slowjo
daurnimator: just regular zig build

1638198108
daurnimator!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
with which flags (and for which project?)

1638198333
slowjo!~slowjo@sourcehut/user/slowjo
i don't have the project online anywhere yet, but the build.zig file is adapted from this: https://github.com/rbino/zig-stm32-blink/blob/master/build.zig

1638198360
slowjo!~slowjo@sourcehut/user/slowjo
and i haven't changed the 'mode = b.standardReleaseOptions();' line

1638198381
slowjo!~slowjo@sourcehut/user/slowjo
so it should just do a regular debug build afaik

does zig have a stack data structure?

1638224156
Franciman!~Franciman@mx1.fracta.dev
I get extremely bored and don't want to implement one on top of ArrayList

T.T

tgschultz!AdiIRC@047-034-058-084.res.spectrum.com
ArrayList is already a stack

1638224900
Franciman!~Franciman@mx1.fracta.dev
srsly?

1638224912
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
yeah, think about it

1638224913
tgschultz!AdiIRC@047-034-058-084.res.spectrum.com

I think I should download zig library for better

I'd like to learn me some Zig. I've been avidly reading about it for a while on HN. I'm sure I can find a tutorial or 2 for playing with it on my mac. But where it would be more useful/meaningful to me, is to play with it in an embedded microcontroller environment. Has anyone had any success running it on a Raspberry Pico? or any other uc?

1638226198
Franciman!~Franciman@mx1.fracta.dev
i think it's already feasible thanks to llvm

1638226202
Franciman!~Franciman@mx1.fracta.dev
and encouraged

one of zig's objectives is working on all sorts of platforms

even if I don't yet see bindings for openmpi :P
