ok, the plan9 linker did have some bugs in it

1626532251
g-w1!~g-w1@pool-96-232-174-225.nycmny.fios.verizon.net
working on fixing them (should be good-to-go by tmrw at latest)

Hi I'm trying to build Zig and I'm getting "Found relative path while evaluating include directories of "<x>"" errors

1626547173
fghsgh!~erik@d54C0B83A.access.telenet.be
okay I was just stupid and didn't install all of the dependencies

iohzrd!~iohzrd___@192.252.212.16
anyone know of any zig bindings to rust code that I could use as an example to write the same?

1626550213
b_jonas!~x@catv-176-63-12-30.catv.broadband.hu
iohzrd: I think you do that by exporting an interface with the C ABI such that it's in principle callable from C (though you likely won't need any C code for this), and then writing a binding in zig to that C interface. they're designed well, you can export or import such interfaces easily from any of C++, rust, zig (and more), and whoever writes that interface doesn't have to know anything about the other 

1626550219
b_jonas!~x@catv-176-63-12-30.catv.broadband.hu
language that they're imported to

1626550273
b_jonas!~x@catv-176-63-12-30.catv.broadband.hu
this also means you don't need to find a channel on IRC that can help you in both rust and zig, you can ask about the rust half from rust folks and the zig half from zig folks

1626550348
iohzrd!~iohzrd___@192.252.212.16
reason I ask is because this project: https://tauri.studio/en/

1626550366
iohzrd!~iohzrd___@192.252.212.16
which is written in rust, trying to compete with electron

1626550377
iohzrd!~iohzrd___@192.252.212.16
but they plan on adding various bindings

1626550391
iohzrd!~iohzrd___@192.252.212.16
so i figured it would be cool to write some zig bindings

1626550450
b_jonas!~x@catv-176-63-12-30.catv.broadband.hu
ok. I'm not familiar with that project or web frontends. I am more interested in the bindings part.

1626550521
iohzrd!~iohzrd___@192.252.212.16
yeah, i know they have C bindings and DENO bindings planned, but I'd like to do the Zig bindings, and I just don't know exactly where to start

1626550682
b_jonas!~x@catv-176-63-12-30.catv.broadband.hu
are there any bindings for things other than rust done yet?

1626550701
b_jonas!~x@catv-176-63-12-30.catv.broadband.hu
though I guess python bindings wouldn't help too much

1626551048
iohzrd!~iohzrd___@192.252.212.16
None of the bindings are complete yet, just a basic C prototype

1626551088
iohzrd!~iohzrd___@192.252.212.16
how cool would it be to be able to write cross-platorm web-style desktop apps in Zig though...

1626551236
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
as a user I much prefer the native GUI experience

1626551606
iohzrd!~iohzrd___@192.252.212.16
Yeah, they certainly tend to be much more performant...

1626551629
iohzrd!~iohzrd___@192.252.212.16
but i think there's something to be said about having a UI experience that's uniform across platforms

1626551728
iohzrd!~iohzrd___@192.252.212.16
and of course electron is a security and performance nightmare, so having a competitor to it is a step in the right direction

1626551907
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
yeah it's a fundamentally difficult problem to solve

1626551923
iohzrd!~iohzrd___@192.252.212.16
absolutely

1626551936
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
consistent experience across platforms is directly at odds with a consistent experience within a given platform, and then accessibility is at odds with both in different ways

1626552105
iohzrd!~iohzrd___@192.252.212.16
can you elaborate on the accessibility point a bit?

1626552175
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
each OS has different accessibility mechanisms that you gain or lose by not using their APIs. however you might implement some accessibility improvements in the application, which would apply to all platforms if you use a strategy that ignores OS differences

1626552491
iohzrd!~iohzrd___@192.252.212.16
I don't know this for sure, but I'd assume a prject like Tauri would have better accissability integration than something like electron do to the fact that it's basically just directly abstracting various system webviews

1626552706
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
that seems like a somewhat flawed approach because the web is such an insanely complicated mess that no two browsers etc. handle the same way (ignoring the fact that most of them are just slightly rebranded chrome now), which means you immediately lose the consistency you get from shipping a known specific frontend with your app, electron-style

1626552954
iohzrd!~iohzrd___@192.252.212.16
agreed, but I think the other side of that coin is that it could put pressure on the various upstream web engines to move toward consistency

1626553059
iohzrd!~iohzrd___@192.252.212.16
that being said, I have more faith in that happening in the WebView2 and WebKitGTK worlds than in WebKit on macOS

1626553357
torque!~tachyon@user/torque
I think consistency is more of a technical issue than a motivational one, it's essentially impossible to do if there's more than one implementation

1626553943
iohzrd!~iohzrd___@192.252.212.16
That's probably true, but it doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement towards consistency.

1626554443
iohzrd!~iohzrd___@192.252.212.16
And since the purpose of projects like Tauri and electron is more to use html/web for desktop app than for general web browsing, a lot of the complexities of the web are reduced right off the bat
