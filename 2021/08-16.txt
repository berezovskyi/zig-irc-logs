i'm trying to write a function that will be called from c that takes in a void*

1629103551
ntgg!~ntgg@pool-108-52-163-71.phlapa.fios.verizon.net
but when I try to do [*c]c_void it says c pointers annot point to opaque types

1629103561
ntgg!~ntgg@pool-108-52-163-71.phlapa.fios.verizon.net
what's the right way to do that?

1629103631
ntgg!~ntgg@pool-108-52-163-71.phlapa.fios.verizon.net
this is the current function signature: `fn windowEventWatch(data: [*c]c_void, event: [*c]c.SDL_Event) callconv(.C) c_int`

ntgg: *c_void or ?*c_void

1629107568
ifreund!~ifreund@user/ifreund
a [*c] pointer may point to one or many items, and since c_void is an opaque type the "many items" case would make no sens

1629107573
ifreund!~ifreund@user/ifreund
hence the compile error

ifreund: I was able to figure it out after messing with stuff and getting a more useful error message, but your explanation  was very useful

Hey guys, how do I link a static library (.a) in my build.zig? I recall that 'builder.linkStaticLibrary' existed at some point, but I can't seem to find it anymore?

1629112134
ifreund!~ifreund@user/ifreund
forgot-password: are you building the library from source in your build.zig or are you using a library that's already compiled?

1629112154
ifreund!~ifreund@user/ifreund
builder.linkLibrary() and build.linkSystemLibrary() can do those two things

1629112162

I'm trying to use one that's already compiled

1629112240
forgot-password!~forgot-pa@94.186.212.25
I compile a static library from swift code, which I want to call from Zig

1629112356
forgot-password!~forgot-pa@94.186.212.25
linkSystemLibrary didn't work either, does it have to follow a specific naming scheme so it can find it?

1629112447
ifreund!~ifreund@user/ifreund
forgot-password: you probably need to addIncludeDir()

where do I go to look at what @import("builtin") provides?

1629113590
ntgg!~ntgg@pool-108-52-163-71.phlapa.fios.verizon.net
I thought I could call like zig builtin and it would list it all but that isn't the case

Hello everyone, any idea what's wrong with this piece of code http://ix.io/3wdf ? I get `error: unable to evaluate constant expression` for that `encode_gdt_entry(GDT[0]),` line but the error is cryptic to me :)

1629148197
ifreund!~ifreund@user/ifreund
amine: that error generally means something isn't comptime-known but is required to be so

1629148222
ifreund!~ifreund@user/ifreund
making GDT const instead of var should fix that one

1629148259
ifreund!~ifreund@user/ifreund
or using a `const initial_GDT` to initialize the var GDT

1629148269
ifreund!~ifreund@user/ifreund
(and encoded_gdt)

no problem! as you may have guessed, error messages aren't a top priority yet

How can I make a Unix socket in Zig? I have no previous experience with Unix sockets in general
