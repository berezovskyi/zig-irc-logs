I've been working on updating the Zig Language Reference. A work in progress can be seen at https://paulespinosa.github.io/zig-langref/index.html

discipulus: "updating" as in updating content that's out of date or just subjective style tweaks?

1629290364
discipulus!~discipulu@user/discipulus
Both

1629290400
ifreund!~ifreund@user/ifreund
discipulus: if you intend to upstream these changes, I'd recommend keeping those things as separate as possible

1629290448
ifreund!~ifreund@user/ifreund
also break it up into smaller, self-contained changes. If you dump everything I see there as a single PR it's not very likely to get merged tbqh

1629290449
discipulus!~discipulu@user/discipulus
The work so far has been fixing html and style tweaks

1629290457
Ristovski!~Ristovski@hellomouse/perf/ristovski
discipulus: I like the accented zig source file 'boxes'

1629290513
ifreund!~ifreund@user/ifreund
content updates for the docs are the most objective and one of the easiest things to merge 

1629290556
discipulus!~discipulu@user/discipulus
some accessiblity concerns have been addressed. e.g. contrast and line-height.

1629290559
ifreund!~ifreund@user/ifreund
style changes are often subjective, and you don't want all your content work and objective style improvements to be blocked on one more subjective change that some people disagree with

1629290573
ifreund!~ifreund@user/ifreund
discipulus: to be clear I'm not trying to discourage you, I think this is very valueable work

1629290585
discipulus!~discipulu@user/discipulus
I know

1629290594
ifreund!~ifreund@user/ifreund
I'm just trying to help you get this upstreamed as painlessly as possible so everyone can benefit

I for one approve of discipulus's style changes; I find it *way* nicer. http://pixelhero.dev/tmp/b71460f7385ebed6abfae51c863179b0cce6d21b.png

1629317233
noam!~noam@104.232.42.247
Just looking at it side by side, it's way more readable

1629317287
noam!~noam@104.232.42.247
Doubt it means much, but I vote for upstreaming :P

Hmm, 9term

noam auguste had a good suggestion about the title bars being too big

1629320402
haze!~haze@cpe-68-174-134-17.nyc.res.rr.com
but other than that ia gree

I find the Solarized blocks weird

1629321394
Nulo!~Nulo@user/nulo
Like, they don't fit

oh totally

1629321879
haze!~haze@cpe-68-174-134-17.nyc.res.rr.com
it could use better styling but imho i kinda liked it

1629321890
haze!~haze@cpe-68-174-134-17.nyc.res.rr.com
it doesnt look like another code block

1629321896
haze!~haze@cpe-68-174-134-17.nyc.res.rr.com
it's not supposed to fit* i think

1629322676
Nulo!~Nulo@user/nulo
I mean, fit as in make sense in the colorscheme

1629322682
Nulo!~Nulo@user/nulo
Otherwise I really like it

Just lent a hand to the person updating void's rust package to 1.54.0, including all the patches needed to get it working on as many of void's target platforms as possible

1629328489
ifreund!~ifreund@user/ifreund
I think we should make it a goal that no distro needs to patch zig

1629328530
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
I agree with the goal

1629328584
ifreund!~ifreund@user/ifreund
part of that will be communicating that goal to maintainers and working with them on upstream solutions for the inevitable things they will want to patch

1629328593
ifreund!~ifreund@user/ifreund
I have high hopes for zig though :)

1629328618
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
I do foresee some negotiations taking place

1629328831
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
but I think we should be able to come to agreements since ultimately both parties want the best user experience

1629328874
Nulo!~Nulo@user/nulo
andrewrk: Would you say Rust doesn't? :P

1629328914
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
I would say that many other upstream projects don't understand the motivations and workings of distro maintainers

1629328919

1629329030
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
as an example, the node.js mailing list was pretty hostile about debian's decision to patch the executable name from /usr/bin/node to /usr/bin/nodejs due to a namespace collision from a much older project, and arguably more aptly named
