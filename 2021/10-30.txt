when declaring a method for a struct, what is the difference between myMethod(self: MyStruct, ...) and myMethod(self: *const MyStruct, ...)? is the former call by-value, i.e. a copy of Mystruct is made for self?

nmeum: myMethod(self: MyStruct, ...) the compiler will choose to pass a copy or reference. https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Pass-by-value-Parameters

i'd basically like to make a repo... and then that repo will require some forks of other repos so it would be nice if they all landed in the same group
