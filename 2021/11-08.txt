Nulo: compile it yourself with different flags if you have a >10 year old processor

that's going to be kinda hard with only 4 GiB of RAM and stage1's memory usage...

ifreund: you don't have to compile it on your target.... if you really don't have any of your own hardware more recent then use some cloud provider's free tier

Does OpenSUSE's OBS provide that possibility?

I'm getting an "index out of bounds" exception when slicing a double-buffered pointer past it's first half

1636390859
marler8997!~marler899@204.229.3.4
I have no idea how Zig know how big the buffer is, it's just a poinger

oh nevermind it was just a bug...good thing that worried me for a second

freshcoffee, are you around? I'm available to do the ci switchover now 

1636397451
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
ok can you eyeball the changes to ci/azure? I went the lazy route and had macos provide version, and changed pipelines.yml to use that one instead. untested but I think it will take

1636397478
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
ah I see the problem you were trying to solve. sorry for the unhelpful advice earlier

1636397507
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
looks like master branch still prints env to the log

1636397520
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
please be very careful not to dump env vars now that I am putting the secrets in there

1636397543
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
yeah I'll re-check the PR now. pretty sure I nuked any/all env dumps.

1636397594
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
yup clear of "env" or "sort" commands. Also to care to maintain the "set +x" situations.

1636397776
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
what's cool in the new drone.yml is that for pull-request the step:package, and on-master-success pipeline are elided

1636397819
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
nice

1636397947
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
pr just now says it needs to rebase, you want me to do it?

1636398153
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
freshcoffee, one sec- putting the secrets in

1636398184
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
btw is there a setting to redirect http to https?

1636398282
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
the server is configured to use https, so maybe the developer settings on github (developer -> oauth -> drone   <---- here you should see 2 urls. make sure both have "https:" in front

1636398371
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
when I hover over "All checks have passed" for ci.ziglang.org details, it shows as https for me and same after clicking it

1636398441
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
freshcoffee, ok secrets are in. would you like to rebase the PR or merge it into master?

1636398448
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
yup one sec.

1636398495
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
to be clear I needed to remove the env thing *before* putting the secrets into the settings, otherwise there would be a race condition where another person pushed a commit to master and the secrets got dumped

1636398535
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
yeah I get that now. also I _think_ the way drone works is we still wouldn't see them because the step didn't import the secret env in drone.yml

1636398593
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
(the step that was doing `env`) . that's one reason why I like how explicit drone needs to be. oh, I see a fix.

1636398607
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
we only need AWS secrets for step:package,

1636398625
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
and we only need SRHT for the step:on-master-success 

1636398659
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
ahh I see. yes I think you are right

1636398757
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
ok rebased and scoped the secrets to their respective pipeline steps

1636398762
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
merge ?

1636398871
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
freshcoffee, go for it!

1636398917
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
done; fingers-crossed.

1636398924
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
:D

1636399086
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
looks like it's time for me to integrate it with gotta-go-fast now too :)

1636399128
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
fyi making good progress on qemu vm. there's lots of technical issues that came up but boy am I learning alot about containers vs vm. I'm currently coming up with a way to ensure each VM gets its own host-visible ssh port to issue commands.

1636399154
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
qemu vm is for freebsd, netbsd, correct? anything else?

1636399185
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
yes and openbsd too (if I get a general qemu/openbsd performance problem worked out), and dragonfly if you want

1636399210
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
cool

1636399237
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
feel free to add dragonflybsd

1636399267
semarie!~semarie@user/semarie
openbsd could be build tested (crosscompiled from linux) without too much work if qemu/openbsd doesn't work well

1636399390
semarie!~semarie@user/semarie
(I have a script to setup a ZIG_LIBC environment)

1636399580
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
semarie: when in qemu kvm, there's some real odd thing where clock is getting in the way. Quite a few reports about "sleep 10" taking awfully long, etc, and to try different qemu clock, or openbsd sysctl

1636399594
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
but I would def like to shoot for getting a vm going

1636399640
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
I've seen issues with virtualbox and openbsd guest too

1636399651
semarie!~semarie@user/semarie
freshcoffee: which version ? latest 7.0 ?

1636399718
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
yes I tried 7.0 very recently for qemu guest. Haven't tried 6.9 tbh.

1636399835
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
ah nice the push to master has active step:package and pipeline:on-master-success

"Azure, you've been a good friend to us but can you see the door? There's the door." :)

1636400499
semarie!~semarie@user/semarie
freshcoffee: could you put somewhere output of 'dmesg' , 'sysctl | grep kern.timecounter' , 'time sleep 10' ?

1636400510
semarie!~semarie@user/semarie
a pastebin or a mail (semarie AT openbsd.org)

1636401237
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
freshcoffee, will we be able to do windows on ci.ziglang.org?

1636401249
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
it's on the TODO :)

1636401254
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
cool

1636401284
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
macos will be tricky then, the last thing keeping our dependency on azure afloat

1636401598
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
lots of possibilities. one is a bare-metal macos with 16 GiB ram and still use a vm runner to contain the pipeline runs, assuming a decent version of macos can run as qemu or vbox guest

1636401645
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
I know parallels works but freebies first

1636402203
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
makes sense

1636405345
freshcoffee!~fresh@user/freshcoffee
heh the arm64 drone server takes about 6 minutes to `tar cfJ` artifact, and zinc takes 1 minute
