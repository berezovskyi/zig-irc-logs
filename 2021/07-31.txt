Hi, I would like to thank the people who helped me with developing my first real program in Zig. I created a small commandline wrapper around the bcrypt library of the Zig std-lib. The most difficult part for me was turning off the echo on the command line when entering a password. If you´re interested, here´s the link: https://github.com/Daimanta/bcrypt-encoder

speaking of which, any news on deflate in std? there's been some discussion in https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/2851 which relates to https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/213, but no recent activity

Someone just has to implement and PR it. Seems someone has started some work on it atleast: https://github.com/20kdc/zig-deflate-compressor-experiment

Though, I don't know if they have plans to submit that to std at any point.

Yeah it is. They mentioned on Discord it was their first attempt and was a pretty naive implementation.

But having something is still better than having nothing. It's a good starting point to make something faster at some point.
