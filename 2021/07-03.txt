> hmm would be nice if we had {c} but that outputted \xXX syntax for unprintables

daurnimator!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
we had that but it was removed

daurnimator, is that what std.zig.fmtEscapes is for?

1625292475
daurnimator!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
marler8997: `fmtSliceEscapeLower` I think

1625292496
daurnimator!~daurnimat@vultr.daurnimator.com
so verbose for what used to be a single character :/

1625292647
marler8997!~marler899@204.229.3.4
yeah I think it's a balance between what's common and keeping std.fmt small

1625292671
marler8997!~marler899@204.229.3.4
I'd be ok with some common ones like {c}

if you think about it, the whole point of std lib format function is that there is a domain specific language for string formatting, whose entire purpose is to be compact and convenient

1625294727
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
so I'd be in favor of less verbose ways to expose the features

I'm guessing Zig will win Dave's Garage competition. 

1625295450
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
oh yeah?

1625295454
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
tell me more

YouTube Dave's Garage. He's comparing 45 languages and will release the video with his results later. It's an open source competition that some people contributed zig implementations. I'm looking at a github repo but I'm not sure if it's for this competition. I need to look a bit closer.

1625295652
discipulus!~discipulu@user/discipulus
He keeps saying the current lead is a newer language and says the leader isn't C/C++ or Rust.

1625295722
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
oh neat, I didn't realize that there was an upcoming video with the results

1625295728
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
that could be some fun publicity for us

1625295748
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
where did you see those clues?

1625295749
discipulus!~discipulu@user/discipulus
yes, you should expect lots more traffic if its true

1625295764
discipulus!~discipulu@user/discipulus
I read his comments on the latest youtube premier trailer

1625295801
discipulus!~discipulu@user/discipulus
He has replied to a few peoples guesses that it's assembly, C, C++, or Rust

1625295929
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
that was dnautics doing the zig code :)

1625296105
discipulus!~discipulu@user/discipulus
where you able to find the repo? I'm looking at the primes one. I think it's it but not sure.

cool, thanks. The competition repo is https://github.com/PlummersSoftwareLLC/Primes

V is in the competition, too.

1625296760
discipulus!~discipulu@user/discipulus
Ah but the V code author says in the README that the results aren't the best.

1625302165
ifreund!~ifreund@user/ifreund
I wouldn't expect V to have any advantage over C/C++/Rust

1625302171
ifreund!~ifreund@user/ifreund
the opposite in fact

1625305213
discipulus!~discipulu@user/discipulus
I hope it's zig. I tried to run the benchmarks myself but I'm having docker/dns issues.

1625305668
ifreund!~ifreund@user/ifreund
I suppose we'll find out soon enough

is there a way to "hide" fields of a struct without using `opaque` and casting to the real struct type?

1625315429
discipulus!~discipulu@user/discipulus
oh my, I ran the benchmarks and zig is on top. 30 minutes until we find out.

1625316490
notzmv!~zmv@user/notzmv
dank

1625318783
discipulus!~discipulu@user/discipulus
Well, looks like we'll have to wait for more videos to find out the winner....

is there any reason builtin.StackTrace would be inaccessible?  I'm trying to write a toy kernel using zig.  I'm getting the error `container 'builtin' has no member called 'StackTrace'`

lucus!~lucus@relto.u16.nl
I'm trying to compile Zig from source, but I can't find how to run the test suite?

1625331132
lucus!~lucus@relto.u16.nl
Ah, `build/zig build test` from the root I guess but it does result in a lot of panics

1625343816
lucus!~lucus@relto.u16.nl
oooh, nice, the last commit on master solved it
