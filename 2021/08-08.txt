Hello, after initializing a process through `std.ChildProcess.init`, what's the correct way to write to its stdin ?  I did `proc.stdin = std.fs.File { .handle = 0 };` and then `proc.stdin.?.writer().writeAll(allocator, content);` but that feels wrong other than it did not work :)

you probably need to create a pipe?

typically you need to create a pipe and set stdin to the read-end of this pipe

then you can write into the pipe.

I think the way you did it, is that you tried to use the current process' stdin for the subprocess

but you can't write on that.

amine: unsure if this is exactly what you want, but here is some boilerplate to feed a few lines into `/bin/cat` child process:
