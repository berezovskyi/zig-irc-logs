does anyone have an easy way for me to test https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/9439 ?

in other words, does anyone have a reliable way to trigger this bug?

nobody's "steps to reproduce" are complete unfortunately

oops never mind there's a good one at #9431 :)

andrewrk: 9431 is far from fully reproducible. If you have an alternative archive (zig xz) I can use, I can test it on some private unit tests, which hit it 100% reliably so far

Though it would take some time to set up, which means Monday :)

And I've removed one cgo dep from there, so it's unlikely to be reproducible at all in main. Can bring it back though

why shouldn't I use the @memcpy intrisic?

I mean I don't need safety mechanisms, I want blazing fast copy

Franciman!~Franciman@mx1.fracta.dev
what could go wrong that safety mechanisms prevent?
