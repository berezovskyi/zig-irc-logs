How to compile with zig cc with no optimization? -Og is enabled by default

Stalevar: usually it is -O0 . but I didn't test it on zig cc

Yeah, and it doesn't work for some reason. It is -O0 in gcc and clang sure

Is there a way to prevent zig from optimizing away an uncalled function? Need to take a look at the assembly of a function.

comptime { _ = fun; }

koakuma: but a correction: uncalled functions aren't optimized away, they are not even analyzed in the first place

Stalevar, pass -O flags as usual to set optimization levels
