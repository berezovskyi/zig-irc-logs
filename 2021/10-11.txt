yes, assuming unsigned short is 16 bits

jcmoyer!~jcmoyer@user/jcmoyer
well, it's one possible interpretation at least

if you have more information about how `unsigned short**` is used, there might be a better representation in zig

anyone got any tips on debugging the standard library event loop? An instance of read from a separate connection&fd is blocking during the kevent call

so a ?*i32 is just a pointer to an int that is nullable, is *?i32 a non-null pointer to a tagged union?

haze!~haze@2603-7000-a300-1741-b96d-5853-3f37-d8cb.res6.spectrum.com
cursey why would it be. a tagged union? the latter is just a pointer to an optional i32

cursey!~cursey@user/cursey
i'm assuming optionals are actually just tagged unions when not nullable pointers

cursey: yeah, under the hood they have an extra bit indicating if there is a value or not

Hi, I have a question. I am trying to recreate ´nohup´ in Zig. I´m having good success but I cannot seem to get the output redirection to work. I have tried to create a ChildProcess, set its ´stdout´ and then set the ´stdout_behavior´ to Pipe but nothing seems to happen. Any leads?

If somebody is interested in the code: https://github.com/Daimanta/coreutils-zig/blob/master/src/nohup.zig

ikskuh (or anyone else), do you think installDirectory in build.zig should return the step?

Daimanta: I don't think you want a child process for nohup, just exec directly

Thanks, I´ll look into that. I´ve been making good progress with the other programs as of yet. Zig is quite powerful is most cases and I haven´t found many real shortcomings other than missing functionality from the std lib.
