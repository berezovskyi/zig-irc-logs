can I get comptime function as parameters?

1621383277
Raito_Bezarius
I tried anytype and it didn't work

1621383280
g-w1
how?

1621383293
Raito_Bezarius


1621383294
Raito_Bezarius
something like this

1621383315
g-w1
i see, but ho did it not work

1621383337
Raito_Bezarius
./src/kernel/syscalls/index.zig:4:41: error: expected function, found 'type'

1621383340
Raito_Bezarius
pub var handlers = [_]fn () void{SYSCALL(exit)};

1621383345
Raito_Bezarius
as var seems to not exist anymore, I used anytype

1621383352
Raito_Bezarius
exit is a fn () void

1621383372
g-w1
pub var handlers = [_]fn () void{SYSCALL(exit)}; is line 4?

1621383378
Raito_Bezarius
indeed

1621383416
g-w1
whats the signature of your SYSCALL?

1621383457
Raito_Bezarius
pub fn SYSCALL(comptime function: anytype) fn (context: *FastSyscallContext) void {             │~

1621383463
Raito_Bezarius
but I'm doing something wrong

1621383470
Raito_Bezarius
fn (*FastSyscallContext) should be the type of handlers

1621383473
Raito_Bezarius
in terms of arrays

1621383492
g-w1
can you do `@compileLog(@TypeOf(SYSCALL(exit)))`?

1621383518
Raito_Bezarius
it's worst, SYSCALL was the module containing SYSCALL :')

1621383524
g-w1
ah :P

1621383697
g-w1
yoo it got merged \o/

1621383750
andrewrk
whew

1621383794
g-w1
is

1621383916
g-w1
just search up the scopes linked list until you find a defer

1621384415
Raito_Bezarius
when I'm trying to create an executable with target {.cpu_arch = .x86_64, .os_tag = .freestanding }, I'm getting an ELF with no .text, .data, how to debug this?

1621384418
Raito_Bezarius


1621384431
Raito_Bezarius
in particular it builds this:

1621384491
Raito_Bezarius
though there is a .o beside in the folder with a .text

1621384510
g-w1
try build-obj

1621384529
g-w1
i suspect that build-exe means nothing for freestanding as you are not exporting anything 🤔

1621384535
g-w1
also zig build --verbose might be useful

1621384541
Raito_Bezarius
but empty ahem

1621384575
Raito_Bezarius
indeed, it's calling build-exe

1621384607
Raito_Bezarius
alright

1621384612
Raito_Bezarius
exporting main as _start did the work

1621384626
g-w1
👍

1621384656
Raito_Bezarius
is there a way to have a friendly main if I know how to write down the _start ?

1621384829
g-w1
i would take a look at lib/std/start.zig

1621384836
g-w1
it might have some insights waiting for you

1621384921
Raito_Bezarius
seems like as long as the root file has a _start decl, it's good

1621384930
Raito_Bezarius
but if I want to hide this in some library or OS specific stuff

1621384942
Raito_Bezarius
is there a way to remotely set the decl for root files ?

1621384955
Raito_Bezarius
ha

1621384958
Raito_Bezarius
I understood

1621384965
Raito_Bezarius
if I declare somewhere _start as an export

1621384979
Raito_Bezarius
Zig will just declare there must be some _start somewhere and lld will pick it up

1621385001
Raito_Bezarius
so as long as I import my OS stuff and it contains an export _start and is able to call main properly, it's a win I suppose

1621385041
g-w1
yea

1621385045
Raito_Bezarius
thanks g-w1 !

1621385071
g-w1
you can do stuff like @export(@import("root").main, "_start") i think

1621385344
Raito_Bezarius
awesome

1621385893
g-w1
hmm, is there some way to either make breakpoints on something in another thread or make astgen single threaded (trying to break on a function in astgen, but i have a feeling that it is not happening in my thread)

1621385912
andrewrk
astgen is effectively single threaded

1621385979
andrewrk
I think you might be assuming something that isn't true because I don't understand your question

1621385999
g-w1
(gdb) b AstGen.ret

1621386012
g-w1
r (no breakpoints)

1621386025
g-w1
well, nothing breaks

1621386048
andrewrk
it sounds like it has to do with communicating breakpoints to gdb rather than anything to do with threads

1621386058
andrewrk
try a line number instead

1621386061
g-w1
ok

1621386112
andrewrk
if you're working on astgen you probably want to be using the `zig astgen` command rather than the full frontend. that will simplify your development experience

1621386118
g-w1
very weird, gna inversigate more

1621386122
g-w1
oh, good idea 🤦

1621386702
g-w1
ah, the problem is not that trivial

1621386714
g-w1
i see that anything after a defer block is also in a defer scope

1621391263
andrewrk
stage1 solution is fine, it has a "defer expression scope" that the expression is in, which is distinct from the scope that the defer creates for statements after it

1621402202
andrewrk
if there is an issue that is important to you, and is not assigned the 0.8.0 milestone, speak up now

1621428451

1621428872

Probably a std.io.fixedBufferStream or a std.fs.File

1621428973
Nypsie
This is by simply grepping `seekableStream` and seeing what structures support that. The `read` function could probably use some doc comments to provide examples. (Note that own readers are supported as well, as long as they support the io.Reader interface and seekableStream)

Can I get a recommendation on a good zig codebase that I can read through to help me learn?

1621430084
op_4
has the hubbab over libera.chat been discussed here?

1621430141
ifreund
op_4: not much to discuss, I'm squatting #zig on libera until andrewk wakes up

1621430148
ifreund
will talk with him then

1621430177
ifreund
context for the unaware:

1621430255
Thalheim
oftc may be a better choice because by association if ex-freenode staff founded it, they may not be in the clear yet

1621430371
betawaffle
wasn't oftc also founded by ex-freenode too, just longer ago?

1621430546
ifreund
Thalheim: fair point, I'm now sqatting #zig there as well :D

1621430568
ifreund
from what I've seen so far though, libera looks solid

1621430627
Thalheim
betawaffle: less involved with the current drama

1621431296
op_4
ifreund: great, thanks :)

1621431417

ifreund: I just joined libera now... so far I've lost connection twice and there is no services?

1621431433

there is

1621431446
yeti
but probably currently overrun by too many requests

1621431496
yeti
currently lag >1200

1621431513
ifreund
daurnimator: I think there servers just got overloaded, it was working fine 15 min ago

1621431516

I can't even ping it right now

1621431520

anyhow I have #zig registered there

1621431542

already in my autojoin list

hey, what's gonna happen with this channel?

1621433956

1621433968

1621434030

it's like a bank run over there, people grabbing channels and nicks like crazy

1621434182
Nilium
I’m just sitting on my hands and waiting before I go join any channels and accidentally claim ops.

1621434218
Nilium
Figuratively. Would be hard to type if I actually sat on them.

1621434568
plumm
did you guys hear about the freenode walkout

1621434577
v0idify
yes that's what we're talking about :P

1621434852
plumm
sorry. ifreund are you able to register your nick there?

1621434939
ifreund
plumm: yes I was an hour or two ago, their email server is under very heavy load for registration though it seems

1621434947
plumm
makes sense

Is structure packing implemented in the stage2 compiler? I'm looking to implement packing of unions in stage1, but I wanted to see if there was an implementation I could reference. I couldn't find and equivelent function to `pack_const_int` in stage2. Does it exist? If not, does a spec exist that I have to be sure to match, or can I just do it in a reasonable way?

1621435533
ifreund
powerofzero: no, it is not yet implemented in stage2

1621435543
ifreund
there is also not yet a formal spec

1621435569
powerofzero
okay

1621445636

I want to lookup a convo in zig irc that happened sometime last year, anyone know of a way to do that?

I tend to just look through the logs on whitequark

1621445734

just click through the pages

1621445766

txdv, thanks I think that will work

1621445806

1621450922

g-w1, works exactly the same as FreeNode, account optional but recommended

1621451012

hmmm, ok, i don't remember how i made a freenode acct :P

1621451031

ill just join and see what happens

god dammoit

1621465579

it auto-banned me permanently :P

1621465592
ifreund
what did you do?

1621465599
v0idify
i was trying nicks

1621465605
v0idify
and got banned for spamming

1621465631
v0idify
already appealed, still :/

1621465670
v0idify
deserved though. [i'm talking about the other dimension of this channel, at libera.chat)

1621465712
ifreund
yeah, I imagine they have a lot of people spamming /nick right now :D

1621465725
v0idify
yyyup

1621465769
v0idify
should have been a tempban though, this will just cause a flood of support tickets probably
