And maybe someone knows a solution to both cmake and meson adding -Wl,--out-implib options which dont appear to work with zig cc with windows targets?

Hello everyone! A friend of mine is working on their own programming language, and also interested in zig / taking inspiration from it here and there. We're currectly discussing compile time code execution and were wondering what zig's approach is.

1625845912
copygirl!~koppeh@copy.mcft.net
Are there any documents outlining this, or particular source files to look at?

1625854147
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
copygirl, there are not any technical documents outlining this, but there is this: https://kristoff.it/blog/what-is-zig-comptime/

1625854154
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
the implementation is in src/stage1/ir.cpp

oats!~thomas@user/oats
andrewrk, is Sema.zig where a lot of comptime stuff takes place?

1625854260
oats!~thomas@user/oats
in the compiler

1625854288
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
in self-hosted yes, but self-hosted does not have a complete implementation of compile time code execution yet

1625854293
oats!~thomas@user/oats
ahh

1625854312
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
mainly it's missing comptime variables

1625854350
copygirl!~koppeh@copy.mcft.net
Thank you very much! We'll take a look at it <3

1625854463
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
Sema.zig is probably much easier to read, if you want to fill in the gaps in implementation with your imagination :)

1625854483
oats!~thomas@user/oats
things which are not c++ are usually that way

1625854536
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
copygirl, run `zig ast-check -t foo.zig` on a source file to see ZIR. Semantic Analysis operates on this code and outputs AIR. This is the phase where all the comptime code execution happens

1625854608
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
look for the big switch statement in analyzeBody

1625855172
copygirl!~koppeh@copy.mcft.net
Again, thank you a lot!

ooh nice. totally forgot about looking at ast-check

copygirl: use --verbose-ir to see the analyzed zir (air)

1625863920
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
g-w1, it's --verbose-air now :)

1625864042
g-w1!~g-w1@pool-96-232-174-225.nycmny.fios.verizon.net
ah :)

what's the "a" in air stand for?

1625865222
cr1901!~William@2601:8d:8600:911:cd9b:34f6:fa7f:1b84
oh analyzed*

1625867081
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
yep, that went through a few iterations before we landed on AIR, heh

I will say that before zig I attempted to name the language ark but found there was already an existing systems programming language named ark

"...original goal with Ark is to make a cleaner C..."

1625868081
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
yeah they beat me to it, very similar philosophy

1625868106
andrewrk!~andrewrk@mail.ziglang.org
but zig development quickly outpaced ark ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’ª
