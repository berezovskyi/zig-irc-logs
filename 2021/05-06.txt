marler8997, instead of buying a gpu alone, could you buy an entire machine to get the gpu and then resell what you don't need to save some money? I think pre-builts can still be found at a somewhat reasonable price (sorry for the late reply but I forgot to ask the other day)

1620272886

I seriously considered that route, I found systems with a 3080 for around $3000

1620272917
marler8997
but they were always on backorder, and I just never felt confident enough to pull the trigger on it especially with risk of dammage in shipping

I ended up going with the 6900 xt, my VR looks very nice now :)

Ah, ok...well have fun with it! :)

I'm trying to incrementally migrate an existing C executable to Zig as a learning exercise. I'd prefer to let C be the driver here, and call out to Zig, so that means that I need to have C strings on ABI boundaries. I'd like to call std.fmt.parseInt on a C string, but I'm stuck on getting it to coerce or to convert appropriately.

export fn xstrtol(nptr: [*:0]const u8) i64 {

1620281553
eyepatch0
var str: []const u8 = nptr;

1620281554
eyepatch0
}

Ah. Deleted the parseInt bit in the chat, but it's still in the paste.

eyepatch0: std.mem.span IIRC

lld is a goldmine of subtle bugs

this is so confusing. in builtin.os, we define `.glibc = .{

@noam, thank you. I'll check it out.

Hi folks - Short question: I want to move my test files out of the source directory in a directory next to src. But I get error: import of file outside package path: '../src/FileIWantTotest.zig'. What is the prefered way to move tests out of the source directory. I cannot see a clear strategy from looking at other applications.

1620324098
B767B
Just a pointer would be helpful.

1620324490
fengb
You can set the base directory with "--main-pkg-path" but most Zig projects colocate tests right next to the source files

1620324744

Thanks fengb. I'll try it that way. I have seen

yay aarch64-macos bootstrap \o/

yeah amazing work

Is it not possible to test non-pub functions if the tests are not in the same file as the implementation?

1620329940
andrewrk
B767B, that's correct. however I think there may be a proposal open to ignore `pub` in a test build

1620330006

andrewk That'd be helpful. Thanks!

could i use zig as a resource compiler for c/c++?

marijnfs: kinda?

extern blob = @embedFile("blob").*;

export const blob_len = blob.len;

this auto leak checking that GPA does is really nice for development workflow. most of the time that it reports a memory leak, it's actually finding a critical bug in the incremental compilation system

1620343068
andrewrk
but it's finding it earlier in the dev process while everything is fresh in my mind, so it's easier to fix

1620343228

btw, is (name) aliasing analysis also part of astgen?

1620343660
andrewrk
yes but if there are any usingnamespace then there is an additional check in semantic analysis

1620344174
andrewrk
usingnamespace is a bit of a wart on the language

1620344228
g-w1
agreed

1620344276
g-w1
it could probably get solved if @Type took decls

1620344754
andrewrk
I don't see the connection

1620345012
g-w1
pub const os = @Type(... os.zig.decls ++ bits.zig.decls)

1620345104
g-w1
very ugly if you want to do a switch too, might be too ugly :(

1620345366
andrewrk
how does this address requiring type information to check for decl aliasing?

1620345408
g-w1
ah, this would look the same from the outside, but it could not be the same on the inside :(
