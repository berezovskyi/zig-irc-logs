andrewrk: hmm? how does the jsonStringify not work re: recursion? all of its recursion is comptime-known.

andrewrk: nicely done with the SIMD :) Just gave your single allocation implementation a review, I think it should be good.

1612093961

I'm not sure there is a need for the nicer toOwnedSlice() API the multiple allocation version could provide, we can re-examine if a good use-case is found

1612094115

ifreund: I think the lack of efficient shrinking is a pretty major drawback

1612094176
daurnimator
ifreund: whereas your original approach leaves andrew's version possible, but up to the allocator.

1612094325
ifreund
hmm, that is true

1612108116

andrewrk: updated my PR with a toOwnedSlices() function for comparison

Does zig have any way to detect that the frame you're about to resume has already returned?

daurnimator, re: recursion: my bad, I did not realize that

thanks ifreund

what's the right way to allocate a sentineled array?

1612124104
ifreund
Allocator.allocSentinel()

1612124143
marijnfs
ah yes, didn't see that one

1612124202
marijnfs
and how to I see if a .Pointer has a sentinel?

1612124211
marijnfs
i tried: if (std.meta.sentinel(T)) |s| {

1612124220
marijnfs
but the else branch still requires a sentinel

1612124646
ifreund
marijnfs: the sentinel field is an optional, you can check it against null

1612125031
marijnfs
ifreund: i see, that works.

1612125036
marijnfs
if does the 'grabbing' not work?

1612125055
marijnfs
somewhere else i do: var for_me: bool = if (node.self_guids.get(guid)) |exists| true else false;

1612125062
marijnfs
does that make sense?

1612125083
ifreund
just check if it == null

1612125106
ifreund
var for_me = node.self_guids.get(guid) == null;

1612125107
marijnfs
yes, im just trying to understand why it doesnt work/

1612125115
ifreund
what doesn't work?

1612125117
marijnfs
but you're right

1612125129
marijnfs
In the other case, i didn't get the same behaviour as == null

1612125160
ifreund
which case?

1612125328
marijnfs
the sentinel case, in the 'else' branch it still expected a sentinel somehow

1612125345
marijnfs
but maybe somehow something else was wrong

1612125422
marijnfs
i'll just stick with == null

1612125745
marijnfs
btw, what's nowadays the way to print to stdout?

1612125753
marijnfs
the writers have changed, and it's hard to find an example

1612125823
ifreund
const foo = std.io.getStdOut().writer(); try foo.print("bar\n", .{});

1612125921
ifreund
that is, the hello world in the documentation does indeed work :P

1612129589
marijnfs
ah the one I saw maybe was older
