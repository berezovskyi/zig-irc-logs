How do I create an array of function pointers?

1544938765

Nevermind, I just realised I was doing `fn (type.type) void` instead of `fn (type) void`

emekoi, that could mean that your union's memory got corrupted

1544941454
andrewrk
and you found out when you switched on it

andrewrk: it looks like a struct can have a field 'a: fn() void' and an fn 'a(self: *Self) void'. 'self.a()' would seem to call the latter with the former seemingly being inaccessible. That should probably be a compile error, right? I'm about to go to bed but will submit an issue in the morning.

I'm trying to understand the call graph for resolve_struct_type for issue #1832 (

bodie_
sorry resolve_struct_alignment not resolve_struct_type

1544971565
bodie_
I guess this happens because the field has a self-referential type which hasn't been fully resolved by this point.

Might be a dumb question, but how do I do a for loop over a numerical range in zig?

1544971881
ross_k
I see there are ranges for slices: [0..n] and switch statements: 0...n. Is there something like that to use with loops?

@andrewrk, is there any plan for supporting C++ libraries as a dependency?

1544974557
andrewrk
bodie_, no, no plans for that. that has language semantic requirements that zig can't do

1544980471
andrewrk
ross_k, use a while loop

1544980484
andrewrk
var i: usize = 0; while (i < 10) : (i += 1) {}

ross_k
I see! Thanks.

can we get `and` to work on nullable and boolean types? so you can do `if (true_or_false and maybe_null) |not_null| {}` or `while (true_or_false and maybe_null) |not_null| {}`?

1544989287
andrewrk
emekoi, probably not

1544989316
andrewrk
these are the kind of things where we sacrifice convenience to maintain simplicity

Are there any suggestions for guidance on producing a UEFI application executable, linked with msvc .lib files (EDK-II)?

1544991858
knebulae
By way of background, these executables are just Win64-PE files with a different subsystem linked against the UEFI libraries rather than MSVCRT.

1544993563
andrewrk
knebulae, i've never tried that before, but it sounds like a use case we should think about and support

1544993593
andrewrk
knebulae, it might just work. if you don't use --library c then zig does not link against msvcrt

1544993696
andrewrk
we also have -mconsole and -mwindows. which subsystem are you talking about?

andrewrk: interesting that you say that about C++.

andrewrk: I was actually thinking of the related problem of using Qt from zig this morning

1544995680
daurnimator
Qt of course requiring a custom two pass C++ compiler...

As a *user*, Qt based programs are the best amoung the portable GUI toolkits.

1545003681
daurnimator
as a developer, qt is a huge pain in the arse.

for retained mode x-platform GUI solutions, there are very few choices
