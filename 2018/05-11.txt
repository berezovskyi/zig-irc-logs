andrewrk, huh, I never noticed. When I was doing all the win32 stuff it looked to me like it would just skip anything it couldn't handle.

MajorLag, but notice that it did find all the function declarations - even though their types were specified with macro defines

MajorLag
yeah, now that you mention it, I should have noticed

there's lots of room for improvement, translating macros

Hello, i am trying out zig and have a question.

1526057210
Heimdall
How should I format a string?

1526057237
Heimdall
I tried _ = text.appendFormat("x: {}\ny: {}", mousePos.x, mousePos.y);

hi Heimdall

1526061059
andrewrk
did it work?

andrewrk
oh, I see. I will make an example for you

Heimdall, try this:

std.io.OutStream is the struct that gives you all the nice API such as print(), and std.io.BufferOutStream is a struct that gives you an OutStream for a Buffer

andrewrk, thank you for the example. It works and helped me :). I got a winapi window that prints the mouse position running.

hi andrewrk, real life caught up on me but I'm still planning to work on windows error stacks eventually, is there any progress on this at the moment ?

1526076184
andrewrk
Sahnvour, not as far as I'm aware

1526076193
andrewrk
windows error stacks would be a very welcome addition

1526076206
andrewrk
especially if we didn't have to depend on msvc being installed

1526076311
Sahnvour
yup. anyways nobody wants to have to use DIA :)

even if it only supported debug info that was emitted by ourselves - e.g. LLVM 6 and LLD 6 with the settings zig uses - that would solve 95% of the usefulness of stack traces

I'm wondering if assuming that the .pdb (when present) will be named after the executable and in the same directory is good enough

1526078022
Sahnvour
otherwise, there's .pdb full path inside a COFF section of the executable
