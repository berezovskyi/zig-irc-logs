would it be possible to get zig to generate a zig version of `ucontext_t` in builtin.zig?

emekoi
also i think we should add the builtin `@getRuntimeSafety`.

emekoi, use std.debug.runtime_safety

does that change with `@setRuntimeSafety`?

How would I write the signature for a function that accepts an ArrayList of any type?

IntoxicatedHippo: use `var`: `pub fn foo(list: var) !void`.

IntoxicatedHippo seems to be offline, but also you can do "fn foo(comptime t: type, list: std.ArrayList(t)) void {}" and call it: "foo(i32, std.ArrayList(i32))". If using the 'var' method you might be able to (or in the future) comptime check that it is an ArrayList of some type

std.ArrayList(i32).init(std.heap.c_allocator) - fixed!

andrewrk, it seems like CI eventually ran on my PR last time, this time it hasn't yet. Did you have to intervene  before?

MajorLag, I didn't do anything intentionally with your PR before
