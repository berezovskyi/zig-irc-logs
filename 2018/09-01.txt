andrewrk: automatically translating c headers is such a great feature of Zig

I might be wrong about this, but: for a long time I was unsure about OOP (not inheritance but simply writing methods). I wondered, would I write code differently in C? Are methods affecting the way I write code? Now I realize that it's simply a stylistic choice. What does affect the way you write code are private fields, operators, and the various c++ constructors. Together these things push you towards creating these 'perfect'

mini APIs which you do not need. You make things into what they are not, you over complicate.

Honestly I've wondered for such a long time what OOP was doing to my brain. I think I finally understand programming. I finally understand what is useful and what isn't, what distracts and what doesn't. I've been in anguish for years about this stuff.

i've got this heisenbug, when i'm in lldb its all good, but when i look at it with strace its totally wrong

1535762518

yeah i hate c++, it took me forever to write this tiny patch because of the crazy class stuff :

uniqui_id, what you describe is what I'd refer to as sapir-whorf for programmers. The language you use to model the concepts affects the way you think about the concepts.

looking at

hmm, looks like you added an extra param to ZigLLVMBuildCall for sret

1535764521
scientes
/ TODO Generalize SRet to an NumArgs length array of LLVMAttributeRef

1535764551
scientes
the problem is that building LLVMAttributeRef requires more C++

1535764649
kristate
well lets write some c++ :)

1535764666
scientes
alot is working now with arm64

1535764697
kristate
what happened to function inlining?

1535764738
scientes
that patch looks funny cause its from v1 to v2

1535764741
scientes
i'll smoosh them

1535764775
scientes


1535764786
kristate
actually, the sret stuff should be its own PR

1535764806
kristate
and then we can depend on it from arm64

1535766782
scientes
the way llvm handles attributes is really complicated since they switched from using a bitfield

1535766800
scientes
i feel that the general support belongs in the zig complier but not stage1

1535766883
scientes
as only sret is necessary for getting the language right: byval, inreg, returned are all optimizations

1535766973

meh

I've never been more hyped for better C style languages like Zig and Jai. I tried to design "E++" for a few days. Seeing just how much C++ could be simplified. Honestly..no. Just no. Removing references is incredibly difficult, even if you introduce [*] pointers so * can be used with operator[]. Though JBlow found a way to have operator[] I think. I tried to design a syntax that would not bias towards unnamed constructors. So you

1535767292
unique_id
could have "Vector(int) v !with_size(5);", since no-name constructors get confusing in many cases. And on, and on, and on. It's so difficult to fix C++. Better C > Better C++

1535767334
unique_id
The thing I'm most hyped about is seeing actually good libraries made! All the C++ libraries are so bad!

1535767391
scientes
llvm is a c++ library

1535767401
scientes
but you mean things like boost

1535767484
unique_id
I mean on the API side. Also the standard library. Howard Hinnant's Date stuff would be super useful, but it's made so bad by the C++ness of it IMO.

1535767521
scientes
yeah its impossible to do binary compatibility for c++ libraries too, you ever look at the symbol table of a c++ library

unique_id, zig doesn't guarantee padding or order in structs, so it isn't as big of a deal what he is talking about with integers
