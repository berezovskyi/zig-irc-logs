anybody know why i run "zig build-exe" and the .exe isn't rebuilt but the .obj in zig-cache/ is updated? on windows

1538285292
andrewrk
jrcd83: this sounds like

1538288304
jrcd83
@andrewrk: ty it seems similar but i can delete the .exe and it will not build so it is perhaps distinct from #859. i added a new function to the file and it does this. i can remove the func it and it builds again... zig returns error code 1. strange.

andrewrk: i will keep at it. i like ur language alot ty. this is for a homework max subarray algorithm:

Hi. I'm getting compiler crashes when I try to compile a small app with an objective-c static library. Is this a known issue? Should i create an issue on github? Reduced repro case:

1538327973
andrewrk
srgpqt, I'll have a look

1538328588
andrewrk
srgpqt, what objective c compiler are you using?

1538329263
andrewrk
can I see the full output you're getting?

i have the crash logs too

I'll try reinstalling llvm and see if it makes a difference

1538329674
andrewrk
that's not likely to change anything

1538329706
srgpqt
I was using llvm compiled from source, so who knows

1538329770
andrewrk
me :)

1538329812
srgpqt
well you were right, same crash ;-)

1538330028
andrewrk
srgpqt, I'm not able to reproduce your crash - I get "Undefined symbol: app.o: _oops"

1538330054
andrewrk
can you run `zig build --verbose` and link me to a paste of the output?

1538330218
andrewrk
oh, your crash log has a stack trace

1538330237
andrewrk
damn, it's crashing in the macho linker

1538330252
srgpqt
Add the verbose output as comment to that gist

1538330256
srgpqt
Added*

1538330268
andrewrk
srgpqt, here's the situation. the MACH-O code in LLD is not mature because nobody in the LLVM community cares about it

1538330298
andrewrk
so you have found a bug in the mach-o code of LLD

1538330330
andrewrk
this is one of the motivating factors of

1538330332
srgpqt
Doesn't Apple care about it? Since every last piece of software they make is built with it

1538330336
andrewrk
which is an issue for zig to have its own linker

1538330353
andrewrk
apple uses the native linker, not LLD

1538330372
srgpqt
I thought lld was the native linker nowadays

1538330392
andrewrk
yeah that seems like where things were going

1538330450
andrewrk
so, unfortunately you are blocked by a problem to which the solution is a large effort

1538330470
andrewrk
as a workaround, I think you could use zig to produce a .o file, and then link with the system linker

1538330488
srgpqt
Sigh. I guess this makes it impossible to build zig apps that need objective-c pieces? Probably could build zig libs and link them into objective-c apps..

1538330544
srgpqt
Yeah, your workaround is what i was basically thinking of. Ah well

1538330575
andrewrk
yeah. sorry about that. I should just start the zig linker project. linking isn't that hard

1538330615
tbodt
can zig be configured to use the system linker?

1538330640
srgpqt
Yeah, I was looking into the Mach-O spec myself, to understand how build toolchains all work.. i should revisit that

1538330646
andrewrk
tbodt, not anymore. in the pursuit of true out of the box cross compilation, we have to not rely on system dependencies

1538330687
andrewrk
tbodt, consider that on windows & linux you also need the ability to build the mach-o project

1538336760
jrcd83
andrewrk: i found out that accessing the c_allocator was exiting at compile time. maybe since libcrt is not linked in? i got it working with DirectAllocator

1538336965
andrewrk
jrcd83, can I see the output you're getting? you do have to link libc to use c_allocator. you should be getting a linker error if you don't

1538336988
andrewrk
oh. you know what I've seen, is hundreds of blank lines printed after the error message

1538336994
andrewrk
I haven't figured out what causes this yet

1538337023
andrewrk
LLD rears its ugly head again

1538337148
jrcd83
andrewrk: the command doesnt print anything it just stops and there is an error code (1)

1538337200
jrcd83
i.e. in old cmd prompt i see it with "echo %errorlevel%" and it prints 1

1538337303
andrewrk
the next step to solving this is either (1) get me to be able to reproduce it or (2) you run it in a debugger with a breakpoint on exit and get me a stack trace

1538337561
jrcd83
ill try to get a stack trace, I have a more isolated example btw:

gotta switch tasks cya ty
