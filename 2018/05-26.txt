Hi, I've downloaded zig-linux-x86_64-master.tar.xz. Before I use it, would someone humour me and paste their sha256sum, or point me to the same?

So I can be confident I don't inadvertently run malware. Or if I do that I'm not alone :)

That's what I get too, good.

Um... how do I install it?  There's no README or INSTALL or anything in the tar file.  Help?

1527352094
MajorLag1
Untar it.

1527352096
MajorLag1
that's it

1527352157
MajorLag1
well, I mean, if you want zig on your path there's a little more. Easiest way is probably just to copy the contents of the untarred directory to /usr

1527352214
MajorLag1
er... well ok that's not quite right.

1527352270

I guess I can put the 'zig' binary in /usr/local/bin... but does it need something to make 'import' find the right place, anything like that?

1527352333
MajorLag1
generally it looks in the same directory where it is. I'm not sure how others do it but I just have a /home/me/zig/ and put it in my path. /opt/zig/ would probably be a more traditionally appropriate location

1527352397
n_1-c_k
MajorLag1: OK, thanks.  A little more DIY than I'd expected :)  I'll have a play.

darithorn
all you do in untar it and add it to your path. wherever you want your path to point to is up to you

1527352433
darithorn
you don't need to do anything special to make sure zig finds the stdlib

1527352451

darithorn: OK thanks.
