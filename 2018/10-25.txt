I wanted to ask, is therea reason why functions have a different syntax than structs?

1540490904
Geemili
I mean, structs are anonymous, but generally assigned toa variable, right?

1540490958
andrewrk
right

1540490962
Geemili
Whereas functions have a name by default

1540491028
andrewrk
it might change. structs are anonymous to make it obvious how to do generics

1540491130
andrewrk
right now you can make an "anonymous" function by putting it in an anonymous struct

1540491146
andrewrk
so this is a low priority item

1540491173
andrewrk
there are a few things that could fundamentally change semantics & syntax, and so I'm working on those first

1540491290
Geemili
Ah, okay

1540491628
Geemili
Is zig unlikely to get an ownership system like rust?

1540491640
andrewrk
correct

1540491880
andrewrk
constructors/destructors are ruled out

unique_id
I'm getting "All tests passed." followed by "Tests failed.", though only sometimes. Could this be because I'm returning from main without closing down all threads?

1540498895
unique_id
(in the same run I'm getting these two messages)

1540499342
andrewrk
this is from `zig test` ?

1540499392
unique_id
andrewrk: yes

1540499423
unique_id
if I call std.os.exit(1) then I get "Tests failed" every time, with no "All tests passed" message

1540499451
andrewrk
"All tests passed" is printed by the zig binary after every test function returns. "Tests failed" is printed by stage1 compiler if the binary exits in a way other than a clean 0 exit code

1540499475
unique_id
oh whoops 1 is error isn't it

1540499487
andrewrk
so - yes if you make threads, you could see "All tests passed" followed by "Tests failed"
