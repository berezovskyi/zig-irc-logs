i don't see the purpose of the vectors

scientes, I'm still researching how to do that. I have a few proof of concept implementations, and once it's clear the best way to do it I'll write up the docs

How to convert a character slice to a u64?

1534805129
andrewrk
wink_, I think @bitCast can't handle this yet, so you'll have to @ptrCast for now

1534805155
andrewrk
actually, use one of the std.mem.readInt functions

pub fn readInt(bytes: []const u8, comptime T: type, endian: builtin.Endian) T

that's cool -- building llvm-6.0.1-Release (with all arch's/backends/etc) takes 8:57 with GCC-5.4 and ld but sped up to 7:37 with clang-6.0.1 and lld.  That is pretty significant, at least

that is on a 32 core - 64 thread AMD Epyc 7351 with 128 Gb Ram and 'make -j65', btw

building llvm in 9 minutes - I'm jealous

does Zig default to lld when available? I can look but just thought I would ask

1534805663
andrewrk
can't wait to see how much stage2 can take advantage of your computer once it's more complete

1534805676

zig only uses LLD and does not support using the system linker

1534805677
wilsonk
Yep...looking forward to that also

1534805710
wilsonk
ah, I didn't realize it wouldn't use the system linker at all

1534805966
wilsonk
oh, yeah that build time includes clang and lld also ;)

andrewrk: sorry I didn't make myself clear I want to convert a string of ascii characters to an interger

you could use distcc to do the same with cheap machines
