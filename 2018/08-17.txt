wink_: can you write-up some sort of information on that discovery?

O

1534470858

whoops, I'll create a smaller example tomorrow.

how do I go from signed to unsigned at comptime?

in the first while loop in 'solve', if I change one of the 'part.. += .....' with the if-version, it compiles

1534509554
DutchGhost
but if I do it like this, it does not compile: "note: compile-time variable assigned here         part1 += @intCast(u64, (f[start] - 48) & @bitCast(u8, -@intCast(i8, @boolToInt(f[start] == f[next]))));"

1534510209
DutchGhost
but inserting an if statement makes it comptime again

1534510210
DutchGhost
if (f[start] == f[half]) {}

1534510217
DutchGhost
this is magic xD

1534510941
DutchGhost
even an 'if(false) {}' makes it work

DutchGhost, played with your code, and it kinda seems like a comptime bug. Maybe

1534511051
Hejsil_
It fixed it like this:

1534511111
DutchGhost
huh you changes the comptime var's to just var's ?

1534511189
Hejsil_
Yes. Because your while loop is not `inline`, `{start += 1; next += 1;}` becomes a runtime operations (because each iteration of the loop will be executed at runtime)

1534511216
Hejsil_
Though, you marked solve to be executed at comptime, so i'm not quite sure why the compiler still complains

1534511255
DutchGhost


1534511264
DutchGhost
it's weird

1534511268
MajorLag
comptime be like that. I've noticed that especially when you recurse with comptime it gets confused

1534511326
DutchGhost
huh okey haha

1534511340
DutchGhost
should it be reported?

1534511345
DutchGhost
orrr?..?

1534511352
Hejsil_
If you can find a minimal example

1534511363
Hejsil_
I'm not quite sure what's going on here soo

1534511380
DutchGhost
Ill tryy

1534511413

I'm hoping comptime gets a lot more predictable in the stage2 compiler.

1534511588
Hejsil_
I hope, that with andrewrk putting more thought into the design of the stage2 compiler, many bugs will just solve themself

1534512317
DutchGhost
Reduced PoC:

1534512472
Hejsil
Looks good. Seems to highlight the problem well

1534512491
Hejsil
Actually, there might be two bugs

1534512508
Hejsil
The if(false) removing the error

1534512516
Hejsil
And error itself

1534512572
Hejsil
Or.. Hmmm

1534512582
DutchGhost
this would be a good example to file an issue?

1534512586
Hejsil
Idk, maybe the compiler is analysing the function like it's run at runtime

1534512598
Hejsil
Ye, it's good

1534513889

Got a UDP prototype running

1534513934
kristate
going to clean-up the code and try to get a small udp demo running for the examples/ directory

1534520060
MajorLag
After getting stage2 working, does andrew plan to go back and restructure stage1 to be more like stage2? I imagine that if they're significantly different it'll make maintaining both even more of a pain down the road.

1534520366

kristate: So my initial "fix" for the overly aggressive optimization problem was to refactor out the internal loops I had into fn's and invoke them with @noInlineCall.

1534520459
wink_
but then I determined that I didn't need to use @noInlineCall to invoke them, just calling the "compiler" would line but not optimize it away.

1534520523
kristate
wink_: hmm -- would be great to see the before and after

1534520554
wink_
k, I'll try to make a simpler example

1534531553

I've been doing a lot of work with @typeInfo, do we think it is worth it to catalog all the issues with it in an issue? most of them are just inconsistent naming but a few are design flaws.

1534533464
DutchGhost
can you say something like 'I require this dependency, but pull it from this and this website/github whenever I compile' ?

1534533501
DutchGhost
for anyone who knows, something similar like the cargo build tool from Rust ?

1534537844
MajorLag
@DutchGhost No package manager yet (nor anything like that). It's planned to occur sometime after we get a basic HTTP implementation in std. See:

1534537888
MajorLag
I suppose you could have build.zig cal curl or something though...

1534538321
DutchGhost
ohh yeahh haha, but no official manager yet
