If someone has 5 minutes, could you please pull this branch and run this to confirm it works?

1536458268
tiehuis
You'll just need to change etc/config/zig.defaults.properties to point to your compiler binary but otherwise it should work as is

1536458296

Haven't had the time to look into the temp directory issue but I know this works on a standard ubuntu 16.04 install

well I'm getting some stupid error with the unmodified source code so I'd first have to debug that. It's 2 am. Others, please help.

1536458890
tiehuis
no problem if you have an issue just leave it, ill look into it some more

1536459382
andrewrk
tiehuis, I'll try it

1536459615

tiehuis, how do i turn on zig support?

1536459644
scientes
oh i have to make the zig binary discoverable...

1536459681
andrewrk
tiehuis, I'm currently dealing with "make: etc/scripts/find-node: Command not found"

1536459733
andrewrk
oh, it's using #!/bin/bash for the shebang which is not portable

1536459752
scientes
also: +compilers=/home/user/local/bin/zig

1536459917
andrewrk
how do I change the path from /home/user/local/bin/zig?

1536459936
andrewrk
oh there it is  etc/config/zig.defaults.properties

1536460026
andrewrk
tiehuis, it says compilation failed for me in the web interface

1536460041
andrewrk
on the command line it says info: ::1 "POST /api/compiler/%2Fhome%2Fandy%2Fdev%2Fzig%2Fbuild%2Fbin%2Fzig/compile" 200

1536460061
tiehuis
you'll need node and npm/yarn i believe

1536460138
andrewrk
looking for --verbose

1536460198
andrewrk
I'm looking for a verbose flag so that I can see why it says "compilation failed" in the web interface

1536460206
andrewrk
ah here it is

1536460220
andrewrk
unable to rename object file /home/andy/dev/compiler-explorer/zig-cache/example.s into final output /run/user/1000/compiler-explorer-compiler11888-29811-1afjvm3.2o3s/output.s: file system error

1536460231
tiehuis
alrgith thats actually good, that is the same issue i have

1536460245
scientes
same here

1536460251
tiehuis
it doesn't seem to create the temporary directory in getTempDir in lib/base-compiler.js

1536460252
scientes
although i never got verbose turned on

1536460259
tiehuis
what node version are you both running by the way?

1536460262
andrewrk
scientes, it was in the web interface at the bottom

1536460283
tiehuis
yeah click output at the bottom to see the raw compiler output

1536460288
andrewrk
v8.11.4

1536460315
tiehuis
interesting, i've tested this on 16.04 with ~8 something and it was fine, i was thinking it may have been an issue

1536460324
tiehuis
with my current node version which is > 10 but maybe not

1536460376
scientes
it doesn't give the compiler argument it used...

1536460404
tiehuis
if you edit lib/compilers/zig.js and add a console.log in the options you can see

1536460432
tiehuis
should be something like: zig build-obj --output /tmp/compiler-explorer-compiler11886-13538-cbdx7u.tibug/output.s --emit asm t.zig

1536460477
tiehuis
feel free to leave this for now though, since I know its not just me I'll spend some time to find a fix

1536460511
scientes
yeah till me when you got the bugs figured out and i will test it on arm64

1536460569
tiehuis
will say though when it was working it was very handy and worked pretty well

1536460605
tiehuis
slight annoyance having to use exported functions as an intermediate when usign zig-specific abi features but all in all, pretty good

1536507681

I like the --emit asm, txs. Questions:

1536507711
wink_
Is it possibe to emit Intel syntax?

1536507730
wink_
Is it possible to emit source?

1536507831
wink_
When I use objdump my preferred command line is "objdump --source -d -M intel filename".

I see it was removed in 29defd705dcaf25d4a080f7db8f76e8787fca146, to bad. I see here,

1536528382
scientes
kristate, how are you doing on that UDP/TCP patch?

1536528402
kristate
scientes: waiting for 0.3.0 to land

1536528436
kristate
scientes: more specifically,

1536528452
scientes
oh yeah that is breaking all the arm64 tests

compiler seems unhappy with a union inside a union:
