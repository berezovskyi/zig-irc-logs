andrewrk, yeah, I'm too lazy to compile myself, which is why I never went and built LLVM myself.

andrewrk: Is there anything we can try whe we get error: type '&struct__XDisplay' does not support field access

1519783779
hoppetosse
?

I remember bumping into this before, something about the namespacing of cImports

hoppetosse
Oh, I see, &struct__XDisplay is an opaque type

1519785740
hoppetosse
even though fn ScreenOfDisplay(dpy: &Display, scr: c_int) &Screen { return dpy.screens[scr]; }, Display just chains up to it

I think last time this came up, you mentioned translate-c still needed some work and it couldn't figure out this struct.

andrewrk, Is this suppose to not be allowed? const @"type" = 5; // error: variable shadows type 'type'

is it a known bug that @intToPtr() doesn't work on nullable types, at least not from an integer literal?

by "doesn't work" I mean it crashes the compiler.
