so, with the new deref, we're still using |*x| ?

Any game developers here?

How can I go about wrapping SDL2?

"Create cross platform Zig modules to compete with SDL and GLFW": why should we create modules which complete with SDL/GLFW when we can just use them directly?

hi andrewrk , what's the idiomatic way of initializing allocated structs in zig, if there is any ?

1526755968
Dodo
is there some kind of way to do static dispatch?

1526756936
Skilfingr
Dodo, compile-time duck typing (monomorphised) maybe

1526757030
Dodo
then I maybe should rewrite my whole iterator library to make use of that

1526757090
Dodo
right now its more dynamic dispatch, tho it uses a few heap allocations as possible

1526757156
Dodo
maybe there is a way to figure out at compile time if an Iterator object has a .next() method or something

1526757904
Skilfingr
compile-time reflection is a thing. not sure how deep it is implemented

1526757934
Skilfingr
example: @typeOf(foo).Child == i32

1526757959
Skilfingr
for foo = ?i32

Dodo
yeahhh

right now its this project:

I will take a look. I see you also use Rust?

1526759430
Dodo
Oh yes!'

1526759521
Dodo
tho I'm not really good at it, and have not written th√†t much of it

1526759569
Dodo
do you use it?

1526761802
Skilfingr
played with it.

1526762214

Dodo, @typeInfo(@typeOf(iter)) should be able to tell you if there's a `.next()` fn.

1526762537
Dodo
yeah

1526768546
Skilfingr
Is there a reason why there is no c_char or c_uchar tpye?

Seems to come with 0.4.0 #875

Oh :D
