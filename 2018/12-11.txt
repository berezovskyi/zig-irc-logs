i was thinking about using zig for my next gen configuration management software, ssh would be the only lib i need for starting probably

i could get away of using the ssh client in linux as well, then i just need a popen sort of thing to manage the std/stderr

l1x: if it doesn't, file a bug :) zig should be able to use such libraries easily via @cImport
