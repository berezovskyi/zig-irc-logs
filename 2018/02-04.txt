hasen_judy, I'm new so I don't know, but I've found interfacing to C pretty easy with @cImport.

hasen_judy
the problem with using cImport for freetype is that it's a bit weird and not a straight forward include

1517710129
hasen_judy
I'm trying the approach of manually declaring the functions/types. seems to work ok

What exactly is the deal with the `use` keyword?

1517712434
hasen_judy
I can use it for @cImport but what about regular @import ?

1517712630
tiehuis
use just brings everything in that module and dumps it into the current namespace

1517712637
tiehuis
you can use it for regular imports

1517712652
tiehuis
use @import("std") for example makes ArrayList and debug available at the top-level

1517712692
tiehuis
you can also do `pub use @import("..)` to expose all public members in a module, which is possibly handy if you need to re-export some members from another module

1517712968
hasen_judy
ah, it's probably the `pub` that I was missing

1517712986
hasen_judy
I imported a file but nothing in it seemed to have arrived in my namespace

1517713678
tiehuis
you shouldn't need pub just to use it in that file

1517713693
tiehuis
pub just re-exports but should do exactly the same

1517716967
hasen_judy
pub in the file I'm `use` importing

1517718444
tiehuis
ahh yes, you they need to be visible of course

Morning all

This probably sounds like a silly question, but I've yet to find the syntax in the docs or in the standard library. How does one iterate n times? Equivalent to for (int i = 0; i < n; i ++) in C.

ofelas
have you looked at the while loop?

1517762827
zesterer
ofelas: So you must first define a counter outside the loop?

1517762917
ofelas
aye

1517764746
zesterer
ofelas: Hmmm. Okay. It would be nice to have syntax like "for (0..n) |i| {}"

I used `for i in range do {}` for my language, where `range` can be e.g. `0 .. 9` or `0 -> 10` (same effect), or actually any sequence.

the "for (0..n) |i| {}" syntax was proposed and well received a while back, I think it just never got implemented

1517778715
zesterer
hopppetosse: That's a shame

1517778938
hopppetosse
still might be though, it was never rejected

andrewrk: do the assertion failures etc that happen when trying to do complicated compile time programs just incompletenesses in the interpreter or fundamental limitations that arent of interest
