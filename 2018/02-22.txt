Lot of new keywords being proposed for Zig lately. Personal concern: if one of the goals is to keep the language small and understandable, the trade off doesn't seem worth it.

MajorLag_, I share that concern

MajorLag_, what do you think about the coroutines proposal?

I'm not qualified to offer an opinion. Coroutines aren't something I've ever used come to think of it. I do wonder if the type->type syntax couldn't be used more broadly though.

Like: struct->{x: f32, y: f32}; union->{i: u32, f: f32}; tuple->{u32, []const u8}; This could solve the return type ambiguity.

that's a good observation

I do think that the biggest downside to the resource cleanup proposal is the increased size of the language

1519313740
andrewrk
the only reason I would still consider it, is because requiring some kind of cleanup strategy - or having to specify "manual cleanup" - prevents bugs

"in practice it prevents bugs" is one of the only reasons to make the language bigger

One thing I was wondering about that is, if I'm interfacing with C, there's no way the compiler knows what is being returned is a resource that needs cleanup or what the appropriate cleanup is, so I lose that protection anyway.

I guess that sorta just comes with interfacing with C though.

Oh, and -> doesn't solve the return type ambiguity because you'd have the change the initialization, not the declaration.

true, kind of similar with pointers all having to be nullable if you parse a .h file

Is the cleanup function part of the type signature?

yes
