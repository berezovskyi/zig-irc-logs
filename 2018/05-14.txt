how does embedFile work?

1526322344
andrewrk
bodie_,

1526332855
bodie_
andrewrk -- I was wondering about the implementation

1526333295
andrewrk
bodie_, it loads the file from disk into memory and creates a comptime value for it, which requires quadruple the amount of memory than it does on disk

1526333358
andrewrk
I haven't yet implemented an optimization for this

1526333426
bodie_
hmm, I guess the file io is hardcoded, but if you made it into its own macro, that might be neat.

1526333442
andrewrk
can you elaborate?

1526333450
bodie_
well, you said no syscalls, but that must use some syscall

1526333455
bodie_
at comptime that is

1526333518
bodie_
I guess the idea is to prevent user code from causing other users' compilers to do Bad Behaviors

1526333522
andrewrk
I see. The problem is that we need to make sure that anything done at compile time is (1) deterministic and (2) we can track the dependencies and when they change

1526333566
andrewrk
for example when you do @embedFile, zig may cache the resulting program. but if you change the file and rebuild, zig should figure out that it needs to re-load the file

1526333582
bodie_
neat

1526333609
andrewrk
what other things are you wishing were possible at compile time?

1526333639
bodie_
I was thinking about network IO and that got me ruminating

1526333660
bodie_
what if you wanted to do a multi-stage comptime?

1526333686
andrewrk
go on

1526333689
bodie_
like preprocessor chaining

1526333696
bodie_
that's about as fully-formed as this thought is

1526333701
andrewrk
I see

1526333708
bodie_
although I have thought about it in other contexts

1526333718
andrewrk
I think we need an proper use case to consider this in a meaningful way

1526333723
bodie_
basically a compiler that is just a series of transforms

1526333735
bodie_
hmm, ok

1526333790
bodie_
so if one comptime macro depends on the results of another comptime macro, how do you express that?  just have one call the other and use its return value?

1526333821
andrewrk
what do you mean macro?

1526333834
andrewrk
function?

1526333836
bodie_
I mean a comptime function

1526333845
andrewrk
yes it looks just like normal code

1526333849
andrewrk
functions calling functions

1526333914
bodie_
ok, cool
