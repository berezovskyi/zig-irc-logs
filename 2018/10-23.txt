Since no one has said anything in 24hours+ according to the log: Currently working on reliable in-order messaging over UDP for gamedev. Thought I'd give it a go myself to learn how it works rather than relying on a blackbox I didn't understand.

Zig is really nice for this

Sounds fun, I put zig on hold until the syntax issues have been resolved. I have one project that needs to be updated already

some kind kind of related, i was reading about udp protocols, and revisiting UDT, i found it an amazing protocol, it uses my bandwidth at full from anywhere

unique_id, that sounds like a blast.  is your source open?

Whats your plan for dealing with lost messages?

bodie_: I haven't open sourced anything at the moment. bheads: I simply haven't updated to that commit since I found it extremely likely that the syntax change would be altered.

bheads: I'm figuring that out at the moment. What I know is that each packet has a sequence number and lost packets are not sent with the same sequence number. Sequence numbers just keep incrementing until they wrap around. This way acking can be a single sequence number + a bit field of the 32 previous sequence numbers. So you duplicate acks like crazy but in an incredibly compact way. I'm learning this from Glenn Fiedler's

articles. Reliability is built on top of this

So each bit indicates whether a package has been received, for something like 32 total packets.

I'm never good at explaining things, simple or not :)

andrewrk, or anyone else who knows: I want to see how zig will pack a struct on a big-endian arch. Whats the best way to do that considering there are no big-endian archs or OSs supported by std? I've tried to emit asm for MIPS but it doesn't seem to be doing anything.

MajorLag: There is some big endian support in llvm for aarch64 maybe that's available on zig:
