oh, zig fmt, neat

1523583985
andrewrk
here's a diff of it running against all of std/

achambe
hehe, I can see the parser needs comment support

1523584043
achambe
auto code formatting is such a killer feature once you get used to using it.

1523584056
andrewrk
it's self hosted too

1523584103
achambe
how long does the formatter take to run on the stdlib?

1523584249
achambe
(not important, just curious)

1523584407
achambe
hmm, i wonder how hard it would be to setup the latest zig compiler as a nix channel

achambe, why not use the statically linked CI build of master branch?

1523584680
achambe
Oh neat, Didn't know you could statically link clang/llvm like that

1523584697
andrewrk
it took me several days to figure it out

[zig] Hejsil opened pull request #919: Self-hosted parser refactor (master...self-hosted-parser-refactor)

Does anyone understand this error;

1523617154
MajorLag
from a quick glance, docgen.exe requires the zig exe to be passed in as parameter 1

1523617185
MajorLag
instead it was passed an empty string

1523617252
Braedon
Huh, I felt that super weird why that would fail mhmmm

1523617272
Braedon
Thanks though, time to look through commits to see where I stuffed up lel

andrewrk, Here is a nasty bug:

1523625760
Hejsil
This means, that after the tree is returned from `parse`, it basicly can't be modified:

1523630879
andrewrk
Hejsil, I think this is expected - I would consider the AST to be read-only once parsing is complete

zig/master 1999f0d Andrew Kelley: fix undefined behavior triggered by fn inline test...

1523632424
Hejsil
But it's part of `std`, and people can do whatever they want :)

1523632454
Hejsil
Anyways, I wasn't actually playing with ast when descovering this

1523632467
Hejsil
I just thought I'd let you know about it

Hejsil, that's a good point. it does seem to be a footgun

1523632736
Hejsil
This was my fix. Just allocate the root node with the child_allocator:

1523632746
Hejsil
It's actually not a "GIGA HACK"

1523632754
Hejsil
But it felt bad when I did it

1523632761
andrewrk
lol

1523632943
andrewrk
ohhh, I see what's going on here

1523632947
andrewrk
I misinterpreted this before

1523632959
andrewrk
this is what

1523632973
Hejsil
Ooooh!

1523632978
Hejsil
I've read this

1523633003
andrewrk
one idea is a named return value, and it would have the address of the caller

1523633022
andrewrk
the return value would be the address of the result in the caller

1523633096
andrewrk
oh dear, I've broken everything

1523633104
Hejsil
Lol

1523633198
andrewrk
Hejsil, to celebrate your parsing work, I'm focusing on getting the self hosted compiler working

1523633238
andrewrk
and it's gonna use pipelining, multiplexing coroutines onto kernel threads

1523633243
andrewrk
it's gonna go fast

1523633264
Hejsil
Yes plz

1523633267
andrewrk
we're gonna be spitting out .o files before even all the .zig files have been tokenized
