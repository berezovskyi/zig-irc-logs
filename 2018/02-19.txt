Well, VSBuildTools does contain DIA SDK, so hopefully I can hook into that. We'll see.

MajorLag_, that's a great place to start. hopefully one day we can even improve that to make it so you don't need vsbuildtools

in practice, at least for the next few months, zig users on windows will have msvc installed

uhhh actually maybe not

well to be fair I do have parts of the build tools so I can link with SDL properly. Haven't managed to get it linked statically yet, but LLVM isn't erroring in a helpful way so that can wait.

Ultimately I'd like to replace SDL with something smaller that calls native APIs directly so I can get small single-executable games built.

...among all the other things I want to build I suppose...

Last I tried I don't think I could link against MinGW libs, but that would also be acceptable.

I plan on making a pure zig glfw competitor soon

it wouldn't give you as much as sdl but you'd get a window and an open gl context

and I'll port libsoundio to zig too

Should I document the pointer reform syntax ideas we'd discussed here in the thread? More perspectives on the deref operator might be useful, but maybe the deref operator thing should be a separate issue.

why don't you just link against pcre or re2 or oniguruma or ...?

sorry that was about the start of the regex implementation in zig

MajorLag_, sure! I would appreciate that

I've been really focused on coroutines

this is one of the hardest programming problems I've ever had to solve

it's not surprising it's taking c++ so long to get them

MajorLag_: thanks for the writeup
