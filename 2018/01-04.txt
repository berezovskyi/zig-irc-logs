zig/master 5a800db Andrew Kelley: build: std files and c header files are only specified once...

Mentol
how to append an item to an array? is there any method for it?

1515031479
andrewrk
Mentol, an array has a compile time known size. You can concatenate arrays at compile time

1515031497
andrewrk
if you want to append items at runtime, I suggest looking at std.ArrayList

1515031643
Mentol
so, if I use 'var msg: [4][]u8' for an array of strings with max. length = 4

1515031662
Mentol
is possible to know which was the las position where there is a value?

1515031681
Mentol
to add a new value in the next one

1515031705
andrewrk
you could keep a separate index variable

1515031712
Mentol
ok

1515031717
andrewrk
or you could make the type [4]?[]u8

1515031738
Mentol
for what is '?' ?

1515031751
Mentol
nullable

1515031763
andrewrk


1515031803
andrewrk
you can initialize it all to null like this: [1]?[]u8{null} ** 4

1515031901
andrewrk
hm there is an error in those docs

1515031945
andrewrk
fixed

zig/master 5c8600d Andrew Kelley: add december in review to reading material; fix docs

1515032010
Mentol
and where is the doc. about std.ArrayList?

1515032061
andrewrk
I am sorry, there is not yet published documentation for the standard library

1515032067
Mentol
I would want to concatenate all elements in the array using a character to join them (and convert it to string), if it's possible

1515032074
andrewrk
you will have to read

1515032087
Mentol
don't worry; I'll look at the source code

1515032090
Mentol
thanks!

1515032106
andrewrk
Mentol, at the bottom of thise file you can see example usage

1515032523
Mentol
is there any advantage at initialing an array with null values? [4][]u8 vs [4]?[u8]

zig/master 0cd63b2 Andrew Kelley: fix self-hosted build on windows

1515058112
Mentol
is there any type to handle strings? i.e. when a function has to return a string

1515058141
Mentol
or do you have to use [n]u8?

1515058517
Mentol
and how to add text to a string?

Thumbs up for the "Zig: December 2017 in Review", a great read for me.
