^ not much room for improvement in zig to go faster, without ditching llvm

when compiling the std lib tests in release-safe mode, 97% of the time is spent inside LLVM

and this is what is taking the longest in CI

in debug mode (no optimizations!) 81% of the time is spent waiting for LLVM to generate the .o file

that's dissapointing.

<andrewrk> does it make sense for that to be ~33% of a given compilation time?

<andres> Well, if you disable nearly all optimizations - which your report on the list suggests - there's not that much else that's somewhat computationally intensive.

I have a few C files that I've compiled to .a files. How do I use builder.addStaticLibrary(..) to link them with my project? I'm not sure what to do with the return value

Nevermind, I get exe.addObjectFile working
