wilsonk, I made a change that ultimately will make readline better, but I need to rewrite readline to take it into account

andrewrk
it's pretty small, let me give you a diff to try

I'll make the API harder to abuse too

1539193511
andrewrk
hm actually I think the function is fine, it's just the API being easy to abuse

wilsonk, you need to slice your buffer with line_len

Is there a place to look for Zig build system documentation?  Or, alternatively, a place where it is somewhat documented in the code?

1539193844
andrewrk
diltsman, sorry, not yet. that's a big priority for the next release

1539193896

wilsonk, foo catch |err| {return err;} can be replaced with `try foo`

Arch Linux updated to clang/llvm 7.0.0 on 10/2 or so and built zig with it and it worked fine. Then late yesterday I updated my system and zig and now the compiler is Seg Faulting in llvm::DIBuilder::createFile when called from ZigLLVMCreateFile at src/zig_llvm.cpp:591.

Anyone else seen problems with clang?

1539194403
andrewrk
make sure you are building zig with the same compiler which built llvm and clang libraries that zig links against

I'm not sure what that would be because I didn't build it. I'll rebuild llvm/clang locally with the installed clang 7.0.0 and see what happens.

1539195111
andrewrk
alternately you can build llvm/clang from source and link against that

1539195197
wink_
yep, doing that

andrewrk: Sorry, I had to step away there for a few minutes. Thanks...I see the difference with what you have done there.
