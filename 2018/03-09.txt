I updated zig-mode for Emacs to the latest revision of the language

1520559331

I think I should move it under zig-lang/

andrewrk
go for it

you have the permissions

So here's a better tested version of that comptime utf8to16 func. I'm using it in windows API constants as a replacement for L"string", hence the name.

1520561274
andrewrk
nice!

1520561958
MajorLag2
also, I came accross a thing in the windows api headers. You know what struct with the unnamed union members? turns out DUMMYSTRUCT# is a #define. On compilers not supporting the GNU extension it is #defined to u ... u9 (or s ... s9 for structs), otherwise it is defined to nothing. Not sure if this is useful information for translate-c or not.

1520562893
andrewrk
MajorLag2, does zig's translate-c trigger the u ... u9 thing?

1520562922
andrewrk
oh, the answer must be "no" because you showed me the output and it was @""

1520562922
MajorLag2
probably it didn't because I didn't define whatever the headers were expecting.

anyone had any trouble building with a source llvm6 version?

1520593214
tiehuis
specifically libxml2 linking errors?

1520593274
tiehuis
i'll be looking into it a bit more tomorrow

tiehuis: I had trouble with that on osx, yeah

1520598262

I "solved" it by adding this to the cmakelists.txt:

jfo: thanks, that was pretty much what i did to fix it, too

1520627673
tiehuis
you need to add the xml2 library to the main build.zig file for the tests as well to run them

1520627690
tiehuis
i've mentioned the workarounds for the moment here:

1520627841
jfo
tiehuis: I am wondering what the root cause and solution to this is though, we'll need it to be solidified to ship the 0.2.0 homebrew formula probably

1520627907
jfo
tiehuis: also I don't know if you saw this but I got some feedback on the sublime highlighting package from the package-control maintainer but I haven't had a chance to look at it

1520627948
jfo
not that there's a rush on that anyway

1520628051
tiehuis
yeah, i'll need to look at it further when arch updates to llvm-6 likely too

1520628080
tiehuis
hadn't seen that sublime-text stuff, i'll try address some of those details later today

1520628197
jfo
I would have time eventually but I figured if you wanted to take a crack at it :)

1520628213
tiehuis
yeah, no problem, i have time today

tiehuis, ^ amazing

1520630789
andrewrk
that's annoying that llvm depends on libxml2

1520630852
andrewrk
I'm filing a bug report. it should be listed in llvm-config --system-libs

1520630857
jfo
is that a new dep? why is it different b/t 5/6

1520630890
andrewrk
I didn't run into it and I don't have libxml installed, so I don't know what's going on

1520631359
andrewrk
xml2 thing:

1520631400
andrewrk
it will be fixed in 6.0.1

1520631404
jfo
oh wow I was searching for that like an hour before this was filed

1520639113
tiehuis
it looks like a new thing used by the WindowsManifestManager for lld in COFF files I think
