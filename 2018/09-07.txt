why no for in loop?

1536279295
martinium
I like for in saves time for iterations

1536279310
martinium
or I should say I am used to that

1536279311
martinium
lol

1536279328
martinium
feels more intuitive than old school C style for loop

1536279413
wink_
For me I'd contemplate removing "for" and just have "while" loops handle ranges like "for".

1536279645
wink_
A "do {} until" would be nice for those infrequent times you always go through once.

1536279876
martinium
kind of reminds me of ruby's .each iteration

1536279913
martinium
|value| piece is like ruby and is the iterator in that lang so guess that is throwing me off for zigs while loops

1536280272
martinium
anyone do fizzbuzz in zig?

1536280289
martinium
I need to see more sample code to wrap my head around the lang

my battery died in the middle of andrewrk's livestream!

Didn't have a power supply and it was 5a in japan, so I will try to rewatch it later today.

unique_id, thanks for the feedback! however i have to redirect your praise to verminian trap, the game i cloned (even the specific enemies for each wave was copied)

1536289188
dbandstra
i suppose a good thing to add would be basic menu and a quit confirm :p

1536289307
dbandstra
andrewrk, sorry to bother you again, this issue should be reopened

1536290158
martinium
@unique_id, thanks!

1536291151
martinium
anyone free that can help me with this?

1536291175
martinium
error: variable of type 'comptime_int' must be const or comptime

1536291176
martinium
var i = 0;

1536291210
dbandstra
you have to explicitly give the number a type

1536291215
dbandstra
like `var i: u32 = 0;`

1536291232
dbandstra
or `var i = u32(0);`

1536291291
dbandstra
integer literals have a special type, `comptime_int`, which lets you do some constant arithmetic and stuff without having to worry about the actual storage type until you actually put it in a variable

1536291323
martinium
nice that solved it

1536291334
martinium
also corrected the non interpolation

1536291464
martinium
another thing

1536291473
martinium
want to get my head around the zig for loop

1536291505
martinium
for (condition) |whatisthis?| {do something}

1536291663
dbandstra
for doesn't take a condition, it takes an array/slice

1536291686
dbandstra
for (some_slice) |an_item_from_the_slice| {do something}

1536291716
dbandstra
optional second param: `for (some_slice) |item, index| {do something}`

1536291747
dbandstra
in the pipes are basically variable declarations , but without the const/var keyword

1536291799
dbandstra
`for ([]u32{1, 2, 3, 4}) |num| { std.debug.warn("{}\n", num); }`

1536291805
dbandstra
this should print the four numbers

1536292010
martinium
thank you so much

1536292944
martinium
it would seem that while loops would be preferable most of the time unless you specifically need to iterate through an array or slice?

1536293928
dbandstra
yup

I've updated my compiler explorer branch for zig:

1536298403
tiehuis
I'll make a PR tonight or tomorrow. I have an issue on my current environment but I've tested it and it works pretty well otherwise

1536299445
kristate
tiehuis: good to have you on IRC

1536299447
kristate
tiehuis: n

1536299460
kristate
normally we don't see you here?

1536299756
tiehuis
i usually just read the logs and hop on if there is a question to answer

1536299903
kristate
tiehuis :-)

1536299928

tiehuis: have you ever come to Japan? I read that you live in NZ

1536300379
tiehuis
i have not, no, but i think i would like to some day

1536300417
kristate
tiehuis: I am thinking about holding a small get together for zig members later this year -- maybe October or November

1536300857
dbandstra
wow

1536327080
andrewrk
tiehuis, if your godbolt change gets merged, I'll add a test for the command line parameters and panic functions and stuff that we're using, just to be sure we don't break it

1536333305

andrewrk: nice stream last night!

1536333325
wilsonk
really enjoyed that one :)

1536333330
andrewrk
thanks wilsonk

1536333344
andrewrk
I'll try to do more like that

1536333385
wilsonk
great, I will be watching...well I watch all of them anyways, but I will continue to watch ;)

1536333443
andrewrk
maybe next week will be on syscalls

1536333628
wilsonk
Sounds good.  Stack traces and/or the differences between the three OS's for the zig compiler (both stages) might also be a good topic

1536333653
andrewrk
agreed

1536337564
MajorLag
Is there no issue for the compiler crashing when undeclared identifiers are used at comptime?

1536337752
andrewrk
I was not aware of that issue

1536338715
MajorLag
Really? I thought this had come up.

1536338726
MajorLag
I'll put together an example or two and make an issue.

1536338861
MajorLag
You usually have to abstract it a bit for the problem to surface, call it from another namespace for instance. Actually, #1483 is probably another manifestation of the same problem.

1536339497
MajorLag
..hmmm, no it's more than that.

1536342768
cgag
is this first argument redundant: `self.freeFn(self, <...>);` or is there a reason for that? (from std/mem.zig/destroy)

1536342816
cgag
^ i may have sent htat before, idk, apparently i lost my connection to freenode with irccloud and didn't notice

1536342825
andrewrk
cgag, note that freeFn is a function pointer field, not a method

1536342942
cgag
ah, makes sense

1536344475
MajorLag
andrewrk: I've spent about an hour trying to find or recreate a case where a compileError thrown at comptime results in a crash to no avail. Next time I run into one naturally I'll be sure to minimize it and make an issue.

1536344499
andrewrk
MajorLag, my apologies. if your code is open source I'd be happy to look at it

1536345335
MajorLag
I can't even make it happen right now in source where I know I ran into it, otherwise I'd take you up on that.

1536345425
MajorLag
It's possible one of the causes was fixed.

1536345568
andrewrk
I did fix quite a few bugs this week

1536345867
MajorLag
ok, a struct seems to be a necessary part of the equation. Specifically a generated struct;

1536346061
MajorLag
#1438 now has a more minimized example.

1536346577
MajorLag
I'm pretty sure this is the core issue I've been running into. I've written lots of comptime voodoo lately.

1536346877
andrewrk
nice

1536346909
andrewrk
MajorLag, typo? what's the issue number?

1536346916
andrewrk
ah, 1483

1536346936
MajorLag
yeah, typo, my bad

1536347889
andrewrk
MajorLag, fixed

1536347993
MajorLag
thanks

1536354368

andrewrk: in #1484 I added two other working solutions and it just seems odd that the most obvious one, to me, is an error.

1536356310
andrewrk
wink_, zig does not have a hidden reference type

1536357177
hoppetosse
andrewrk: pushed the commit for the offset functions PR

1536357203
andrewrk
hoppetosse, I'll have a look!

1536357286
hoppetosse
If the control flow seems weird, let me know. I might have sacrificed some readability for the sake of less code duplication
