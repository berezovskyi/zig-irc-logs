Andrew created `fn ptr` in his tetris game (

Any suggestions on how the code duplication could be removed?

wink_, how about this?

1539453873

Perfect, txs. I changed getPtrType to cvrtPtrToOptionalPtrArray which, I think, is more precise. What do you think?

How do you like gitlab?

i'm more familiar with it tbh because of using it at work

1539460995

I've not really used it yet, but was thinking of giving it a try.

txs for the code snippet, I like it much better!

1539461094
dbandstra
no problem

andrewrk, i was away for a few weeks, now trying my project with latest zig. the compiler is crashing (assert in get_abi_alignment). would you be able to take a look?

1539461997
andrewrk
dbandstra, yeah I'll take a look

1539462015
dbandstra
thanks, 'zig build' is crashing

1539462183
andrewrk
I reproduced the crash

1539462575

i think vs code must be hardwired to look for lldb 6 or something. i'm pretty hopeless at this kind of thing

1539462663
andrewrk
I just use gdb command line

1539462669
andrewrk
or lldb command line on macos

1539462671
dbandstra
i know the bt command that's about it

when i was young enough to learn and remember things i was using visual studio on windows hehe

1539462738
andrewrk
dbandstra, sadly I don't know of a test case to trigger this, but I'm about to push the fix

1539462745
dbandstra
oh cool! thanks

1539463000
andrewrk
dbandstra, pushed

1539463161
dbandstra
nice, looks like this->@This() was the only code change needed

1539463227
dbandstra
oh and file stream was moved

1539463259
andrewrk
oh yeah, to os.File.InStream os.File.OutStream

1539463514
dbandstra
bleh i'm too tired / jet lagged to dive back into this tedious project (oxid) quite yet hehe

1539463559
dbandstra
i'm going to try to recreate a weird crash i was getting a few months ago, maybe the compiler will be more informative now

is there a way to cast an unsigned integer to a signed integer?

1539470886
emekoi
nevermind i figured something out.

Did you use @intCast or @bitCast?

1539474386

When you had ask the question earlier I hadn't done it, but believe it or not I needed just now and in my case I was converting c_int to c_uint and used @intCast.
