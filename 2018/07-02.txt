zig/master 0206b76 Josh Wolfe: syntax in build.zig example doc

1530515855
donlzx
does zig has block comment syntax?

1530515945
andrewrk
donlzx, no, only single line comments and doc comments

1530516268
donlzx
or anything like module level "static if" to switch off multiple lines of codes easily?

guys I'm just an interested user, please dont rip my head off but what do you think about adding a language feature that allows json-like dot access of a Hashmap? So that I dont have to write mymap.getValue("key") but I can just write mymap.key

1530541382

hio 1. what if the key is an object?

1530541388
very-mediocre
2. what if it's a string with a space?

1530541414
very-mediocre
3. check out the zen of zig to find out what it is vs what it isn't

1530541434
very-mediocre
explicitness is a priority vs. "cuteness"

looks like LLVM announced their 7.0.0 release date - september 5th

1530561983
andrewrk
zig 0.3.0 will be released september 12th

1530562980
andi3
are there any major changes in. llvm yet that would have an impact on zig?

1530563089
andrewrk
andi3, hopefully, fixes for any of these items:

1530563095
andrewrk
especially the coroutines bug

1530563114
andrewrk
right now we have to disable optimizations for functions which are coroutines because of an llvm bug

1530563134
andrewrk
also hopefully they will make web assembly a non-experimental target

1530563148
andi3
both sounds great

1530563166
andrewrk
we already have llvm7 support in the llvm7 branch

1530563185
andrewrk
so on llvm's release day we just merge it into master, and then spend 1 week fixing bugs and then release 0.3.0

1530563229
andi3
great

1530563233
andi3
... some days ago someone asked about documentation about allocators I'd like to second that request

1530563263
andrewrk
noted. I've been doing a little bit of work on docs every day; allocators is on my to-do list

1530563439
andi3
sure, thanks
