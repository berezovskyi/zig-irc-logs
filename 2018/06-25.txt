is there a convenient way to loop through enum values?

i have var i: u32 = 0; while (i < @memberCount(SomeEnum)) : (i += 1) { const value = @intToEnum(SomeEnum, @intCast(@typeInfo(SomeEnum).Enum.tag_type, i))); }

Have you tried taking the @typeInfo, then doing `for(type_info.Enum.fields) |field| { ... };` ?

field will have a .name and .value

hmm it's nice to be able to use a for loop but field.value seems to be a usize so unfortunately the @intToEnum is still needed

do you know what the `defs: []Definition` thing is? i tried using it but th ecompiler crashed

You still need @intToEnum because the TypeInfo structure's fields have static type. []Definitions holds information about namespaced constants, variables, and functions, if your Enum type has any.

@dbandstra Hit me up if you have questions about @typeInfo, I wrote it

I would appreciate a pastebin of the code that made the compiler crash too

I will finish off basic @reify today or tomorrow and start working on std.meta after that, you sould be able to do something like for(meta.enum_fields(EnumType)) |field| { ... } after that
