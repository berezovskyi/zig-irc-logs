darithorn: cstr does that with &u8 arrays

1527644127
donpdonp
though it has that null byte to auto-determine the size of the array.

1527644437
darithorn
yeah i figured it out i had a brain fart lol

1527644489
darithorn
i had forgotten that the variable was a nullable type

1527664510
t5c
made it to hackernews frontpage (again I think)

1527664674

andrewrk: did you find time to work on zig for openbsd? I didn't have time to continue since I set up the server for you

1527665955
donpdonp


1527665965
donpdonp
yeah still front page (#14)

1527665987
donpdonp
i put a glowing reivew in the comments

1527666096
t5c
heh yeah good job

1527666123
t5c
but its true though, I got interested because of the ffi and the compile times + no gc

1527666139
donpdonp
same.

1527666145
donpdonp
those are the reasons i got into Vala, too

1527666146
t5c
sadly I haven't finished openbsd support yet. I lack of knowledge. big time.

1527666159
t5c
I wrote a lot of rust, and I still like it

1527666166
t5c
but the compile times

1527666184
donpdonp
but then gobject is too crazypants and its so core to vala.

1527666194
donpdonp
i havent been able to swallow the rust learning curve

1527666198
t5c
but I think the language did a lot of things right. haven't had any grudged with it

1527666209
donpdonp
which is another reason zig was interesting. its simpler to understand

1527666211
t5c
*grudge

1527666254
t5c
well, I'd like to say I'm a pretty decent C programmer. I rarely had problems with the borrow checker or lifetimes

1527666271
t5c
although its a very nice feature

so what's the news andrewrk?  did I miss it?

1527695086
darithorn_
if it's the news i'm thinking you're talking about, he's quitting his job to work on zig full time

1527695927
andrewrk
t5c, I think it will take me about 1 month to get openbsd working in zig and have CI support for it

1527695966
andrewrk
I didn't start using the server yet

Leaving a job to work on a project can be interesting

1527714119
achambe
the abundance of time is something that is easy to waste

1527714122
achambe
without realising.

1527714311
andrewrk
achambe, indeed. I'll have the fact that I will be eating away my savings to keep a fire lit underneath my butt

1527714329
achambe
I already left my job, though I had less of a plan haha

1527714336
achambe
just that I was unhappy

1527714364
achambe
took me  ~ 3 months to get a good workflow started for a project

1527714377
achambe
wasted lots of time, I wish you luck! :P

1527714389
andrewrk
thanks!

1527714441
andrewrk
I've done this before and I've managed quite well. I use an alarm clock and keep a consistent schedule. Go to the gym regularly. Go to social events a few times a week. I find it makes me quite healthy and happy

1527714474
achambe
yeah, I started following strict excercise for the past 4 weeks, it helps

1527714483
achambe
I think the clock is a good idea

1527714499
achambe
I was experimenting with using a timetable too

1527714520
achambe
The social aspect is important too

1527714566
achambe
I didn't realize that as much until recently.

1527714712
achambe
andrewrk: was the previous time when you were at recurse?

1527714842
andrewrk
I've done it a few times. recurse was one of them. before that I did

1527714859
andrewrk
I always take advantage of time between employment and try to delay my start date as much as possible

1527714889
andrewrk
this time though, I'm hoping to figure out how to sustain it

1527714908
andrewrk
donations can work if enough people get interested in the project

1527714940
andrewrk
otherwise I can try to do some contracting, or make a game, or worst case scenario part time work

1527714950
andrewrk
but I have a couple years before I have to make these compromises

1527714963
achambe
yeah, I can see how a hard push where you are at that "usefulness threshold" of the project might get enough of a boost.

1527715003
achambe
i.e. toy -> production tool

1527715008
andrewrk
that's the idea

1527715082
achambe
there might be a point where you need to focus a huge amount on marketing tbh

1527715097
achambe
even if its not a paid product haha

1527715097
andrewrk
that can be after 1.0.0

1527715103
achambe
cool
