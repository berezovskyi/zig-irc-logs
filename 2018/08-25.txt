given a list of types, is it possible to create a struct with it?

1535209514
DutchGhost
it'd look something like 'struct whatever { inline for(types) |t| { ..: t} }' or something?

not actually sure how formatting enums should work but it seems to be broken atm:

1535210463
cgag
i can open an issue if i'm not misunderstanding something

DutchGhost: No. This is what reify is intended to do, but we're not sure the feature is a good fit for zig's goals.

1535210784
MajorLag
cgag, what build are you on? I don't see any use of @memberName in std.fmt

1535210904
MajorLag
ah, ok, nevermind there's been an update since a few days ago

1535211081
MajorLag
yeah, that's a bug. looks like andrewrk added some struct printing behavior, but it's very simple right now.

1535211519
MajorLag
you can work around it by: `@tagName(Food.Cheese)`

1535211563
cgag
ah yeah, meant to mention that was what i ended up doing, thanks though

has anyone played with lz4 bindings?

1535215829

I'm having a hell of a time getting my encoded output to work with LZ4_decompress_{fast,safe}, but it works just fine with the CLI decoder

1535216277

bodie_, i've done worked with lzo and zstd in C

1535216285
scientes
link?

1535216584
scientes
I am really a fan of the way go handler IO, even if you remove the NM scheduler part of it. interfaces and being able to wrap something in lz4 for example works really well.

1535216598
scientes
I'd like to see that in a gc-free language

1535217758
bodie_
yeah, Go's io interfaces are really simple and useful.

1535217800
scientes
and its pseudo-syncronous interface is easiest, rather than true asyncronous

1535217841
scientes
whers the zig? sorry, I don't really know cpp

1535217842
bodie_
I discovered that if I just echo the output to stdout, I can use lz4cat to decode it no problem.

1535217861
bodie_
Oh, yeah it's not a zig program, I was just wondering if anyone was familiar w/ lz4, really.

1535217900
scientes
ahh you need to have a bufer large enough for the DEcompressed length

1535217902
scientes
not compressed length

1535217930
bodie_
yeah, I have that.  :/

1535217972
bodie_
I'm using a go CLI to compress and encode some files into byte array literals and then embedding them in the class.

1535217995
bodie_
So the encoder knows how big the original content was.

1535218022
scientes
sounds like premature optimization

1535218125
bodie_
I think it's a sound design for embedding resource files in a game binary.

1535218143
bodie_
There are tools that do similar things for Go and Rust, but it seems like there's nothing like that for C++.

1535218166
bodie_
The fun thing about this tool is that it will support other language literal encoders easily by implementing a Writer interface.  :D

Given a type, can you find out if the type has a method named <whatever> ?

1535219801
bodie_
I think you have to use the type, right?  there's a comptime typeinfo object that has the names of its methods, I think.

1535219967
bodie_


1535220014
DutchGh0st
yeah, you can yank out the 'Struct', which has a defs list, which I suppose are functions?

1535220024
DutchGh0st
or...methods?

1535220625
DutchGh0st
what would @typeInfo(@typeOf(some_struct)) be?
