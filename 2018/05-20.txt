Sahnvour, I added Allocator.construct recently

I've been bitten by ArrayList.resize() growing the number of items for more than I originally asked, since I was then assuming its length and iterating over it to init the elements. Is there a reason for doing this other than ease of implementation ?

1526833833
andrewrk
Sahnvour, yes, it's to make appending to an ArrayList amortized O(1)

1526833852
andrewrk
I agree the items field is a footgun though

1526833862
andrewrk
it's probably the best reason to have private fields

1526836221
Sahnvour
ah, yes of course. it was just weird to be granted iteration on these objects when used to other container classes, but makes perfect sense when aware of it

1526838340
andrewrk
Sahnvour, you saw the toSlice() function right?

1526838415
Sahnvour
yes, but apparently forgot about it :D

I am wondering something is like c but improved, and with buildin package mangment and coroutings, And zig is what we are talking about

1526839788
andrewrk
hi bowman

1526839819
bowman
hello

1526839929
bowman
actually I was looking for binary translate information, then I saw your blog, then I saw your youtube

1526839937
bowman


1526839941
bowman
and this

1526840198
bowman
maybe zig is a good tool to openwrt embeded routers, go has a huge binary size

1526840220
andrewrk
in zig we have --release-small

1526840228
andrewrk
equivalent to -Os for c compilers

1526840253
andrewrk
embedded is a great use case for zig

1526840399
bowman
I will have a try

1526840408
bowman
that`s sound great

1526840730
bowman
oh, Could you guide me how to port zig to arm ?

1526840757
bowman
I saw arm is not available now

1526840767
andrewrk
it is available if you link against libc

1526840780
andrewrk
but the standard library needs more work to support syscalls directly

1526840781
bowman
ok, I got it

1526840803
andrewrk
it is not too hard, but we need a way to automatically test

1526840805
bowman
wow, let me have a look

raspberry pi has poor compute power

1526841288
bowman
andrew , do you mean op1 process chrome book

1526841304
bowman
the develop board of this processer is cheap

1526841316
bowman
about 85 dollar

I'm getting an index out of bounds error when trying to build stage 3, per the readme. Is that a problem for working on the compiler?
