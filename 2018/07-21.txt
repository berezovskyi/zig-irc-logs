@andrewrk Any documentation for cross compiling? Going to look at the compiler flags.

1532166989
tiehuis
kristate_: nothing specific, just look at `zig targets` to see the applicable host-os-environ triples and the corresponding `--target-` compiler flags

tiehuis: thanks!

remember there are only os abstractions for windows/linux/macos x86_64 at this time as well, so something more obscure you will want to use freestanding

1532167052
tiehuis
you can still use the stdlib mostly of course! just not the std.os stuff for the most part

1532167092
kristate
tiehuis: yes :-)

1532167231

regarding os posix support i usually find it best to just build up the minimal set of functionality at a time and get that tested before continuing

1532167267
tiehuis
also in regards to freebsd, i have a semi-active branch with support for that here:

1532167304
kristate
tiehuis: okay, cool -- networking is so underworked at the moment

1532167342
tiehuis
yeah, on the current main platforms with os support there is still plenty of work to be done there

hi andrewrk , I'm back again about the windows error traces. I doubt I'll finish the implementation in a short amount of time since this is proving to be not so trivial, so I figured i'd be better off to share my work now in case anyone can help on this

1532195033
Sahnvour
what do you advise; keeping a branch on my fork, PR'ing it to the official repo, ... ?

1532195057
kristate_
Sahnvour: where is your fork ?

1532195088
Sahnvour


1532195115
kristate_
I would put it into a branch and PR it to the main repo for review

1532195183
kristate_
Sahnvour: branches usually have -issue#### where #### is the issue number

1532195200
kristate_
Sahnvour: if you don't have an issue assigned, please assign one in  the tracker

1532195217
Sahnvour
okay (there is one)

1532195276
kristate_
Sahnvour:

1532195293
Sahnvour
correct

1532195306
kristate_
Cool, looking forward to seeing what you got

1532195328
kristate_
you could call the branch windows-coff-issue721

1532195379
Sahnvour
very rough at the moment, I still haven't really figured out how to map address to source line, but can already sort of browse the pdb file

1532195401
kristate_
Also, place [WIP] before the title so we know to review it

1532195526
Sahnvour
are you ok with having debug output in the implementation or do you want me to clean it up ? (probably still very useful to continue development)

1532196041
kristate_
Sahnvour: debug is fine for now, as it is a WIP

1532196083
Sahnvour
cool, I'll do that then, thanks

1532196091
kristate_
Sahnvour: Thank-you!

1532199079
Sahnvour
is it OK to target master with a wip branch ?
