hello folks

1520086796
noonien
are there any builds of zig that one can use? without having to build zig myself

noonien:

1520089100
MajorLag
for windows anyway

1520089119
noonien
ah, i was actually looking for build artifacts, but in travis

1520089127
noonien
i'm running linux

1520089168
MajorLag
Haven't done any linux stuff in Zig yet, so I don't know.

1520089221
noonien
hehe, i see tha github realeases also only contain a windows binary

1520089256
noonien
kind of weird that there's a windows binary, and not a linux one

1520089325
MajorLag
It is a bit weird, since I think I'm one of only two people here actually using Zig on Windows.

1520089342
noonien
hehe

1520089360
noonien
quick question, i've compiled zig in a docker container so I don't have to install all the build dependencies in my os

1520089390
noonien
does the produced zig library have any more dependencies, or are libraries statically compiled into the binary?

1520089405
noonien
ah, a simple ldd answers my question

1520089406

1520089459
noonien
ah, cool

1520089561
noonien
wohoo, i can finally get started with zig!

1520094658
noonien
does zig not support soft float?

1520094839
noonien
i'm getting the following error:

1520095354
noonien
from what I can tell by looking at

1520095363
noonien
there isn't any support for soft float

hi noonien

1520112938
noonien
hello

1520112943

I need to add another command line option so that you can specify --target-float-abi soft

1520112967
andrewrk
if you like you can replace that panic line with `return FloatAbiSoft` and build zig from source, while you wait for me to implement this feature

1520113137
andrewrk
noonien,

1520113144
andrewrk
I'll get this fixed for you soon. thanks for the report!

1520113182
noonien
that's awesome, thanks!

1520113204
noonien
is that how it's done in other compilers? isn't the float abi defined in the environment?

1520113216
noonien
eabi | eabihf

1520117920
andrewrk
noonien, oh, good point. Should eabi be soft? I can make that happen

1520117957
noonien
hmm, i've no ideea. i'll check how other compiles deal with the target tripple

1520118143
noonien
hmm, as far as i can tell, gcc has a parameter for specifying if the target supports hardfloat

1520118152
noonien
-mfloat-abi

1520118201
noonien
clang seems to have something similar:

MajorLag,

MajorLag
sweet. I'll try it out in a minute. I'm cleaning up my win32 bindings. Christ win32api is huge.
