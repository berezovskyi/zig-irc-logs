hi!

1534358716

hello

1534358740
DutchGh0st
part2 += (f[start] - 48) & - @boolToInt(u64, f[start] == f[half]); <-- that complains about the boolToInt builtin function, I wonder what I did wrong there

1534358840
DutchGh0st
I did import std

1534358993
unique_id
boolToInt just takes a bool, no type

1534358993
DutchGh0st
or well, forget about the u64 there,

1534358999
DutchGh0st
but

1534359006
DutchGh0st
comptime var fd = @boolToInt(false); complains also

1534359031
unique_id
@boolToInt(f[start] == f[half])

1534359066
DutchGh0st
error: invalid builtin function: 'boolToInt'

1534359206
unique_id
you must not be on the master branch.

1534359225
DutchGh0st
uff

1534359244
DutchGh0st
I donwloaded a nightly build that is later than 0.2.0, but thats a while ago

1534359267
unique_id
I just do "git pull" and cd build, make install

1534359269
unique_id
to update

1534359281
DutchGh0st
Im not on linux :(

1534359311
DutchGh0st
I did donwload it from somewhere..mmhhh

1534359377
DutchGh0st
found it!

1534359761
DutchGh0st
but ugh

1534359766
DutchGh0st
all that casting is ugly

1534361479
DutchGh0st
if you have a '@embedFile', you can at compile time figure out how many times the character ',' is in it, and make a constant array based on that number? :O

1534361643
unique_id
oh heck yes, we have embedFile. That's going to be useful! Yes DutchGh0st I believe you should be able to do that.

1534361657
DutchGh0st
oh good lord

1534361666
DutchGh0st
thats gonna be fun with Advent Of Code this year

1534361786
unique_id
having said that, processing data at comptime is probably fairly slow at the moment

1534361849
DutchGh0st
so if you have const byteslice out of the file, you could basically split at some character, and convert to ints if the file is like "10,20,30,40"

1534361910
DutchGh0st
But well, doesnt matter if the build time is slow, everybody only competes on runtime with advent of code ^^

1534362285
unique_id
I just tried your idea. fn count_commas(comptime slice: []const u8) ..., then const array_size = count_commas(@embedFile("test.txt")); Then var a: [array_size]u8; Only issue was I had put the "comptime" keyword before the count_commas call.

1534362305
unique_id
had to*

1534362318
unique_id
so: const array_size = comptime count_commas(@embedFile("test.txt"));

1534362325
Barabas
How's that an issue?

1534362334
unique_id
it's not

1534362336
Barabas
ok

1534362377
DutchGh0st
so that worked? :D

1534362381
unique_id
yep

1534362384
DutchGh0st
thats neat!

1534362464

>  Bug: const ptr: [*]u64 = &integers; where integers is a const array.

1534362475
Barabas
That's not a bug I think. You probably should do

1534362486
Barabas
const ptr: [*]const u64 = &integers; where integers is a const array.

1534362567
unique_id
It's a bug that led to a segfault. I was getting a pointer to a non-const array which was in reality const.

1534362608
unique_id
I should have to do your suggestion yes

1534362617
Barabas
Ah!

1534363042
DutchGh0st
just a little question, if you have a function that does take const [] u8, but does not declare its local variables as comptime var,

1534363076
DutchGh0st
can you still call 'comptime func("whatever")' ?

1534363174
DutchGh0st
for example this atoi() function,

1534363227
unique_id
It worked for me:

1534363455
unique_id
I don't know much about comptime, I haven't given myself time to learn it/read about it. I just tried removing comptime from the parameter and that worked too. Inside a function, you can use a comptime block: comptime { }, and put anything you want in there like function calls and see if it works.

1534363546
unique_id
DutchGh0st: Search for this string in the documentation: compile-time and run-time

1534363639
unique_id
it discusses how functions can be called both at run-time and compile-time

1534363714
DutchGh0st
yes! thank you!

1534363788
DutchGh0st
if I may ask, what are you currently using Zig for, unique_id ?

1534363801
unique_id
I'm creating a video game :)

1534363818
DutchGh0st
oh! what kinda game?

1534363832
unique_id
open world procedurally generated

1534363864
DutchGh0st
cool! :D

1534363876
DutchGh0st
Do you know the guy called 'Jonathan BLow' ?

1534363889
unique_id
nobody has made the game that I want to play, so I have to make it myself xD

1534363906
unique_id
I follow his work, he's great

1534363960
DutchGh0st
do you have any experience in making games?

1534363968
DutchGh0st
before you started this one?

1534364131
unique_id
No. People recommend starting on easy games. I've only been trying to make this game for years, slowly picking up the technical proficiency to do so.

1534364257
unique_id
Unfortunately I got sidetracked into creating my own programming language before Zig came along. But then I got stuck on not knowing how OOP-like I wanted my programs to be, since I was rather new to programming back then. I was also toying with the idea of storing source code in a binary format and seeing how far that idea could go

1534364289
DutchGh0st
damn

1534364299
DutchGh0st
thats more than I did with programming so far haha

1534364350
unique_id
well ive been programming for many many years, just very poorly after I went from c# to c++ since I couldn't stand the language. Now I like my life again :)

1534364382
DutchGh0st
I was happy when I could write 'let x = 10; let y = 5; let z = x + y;' as my own 'language'

1534364406
DutchGh0st
but never got any further than that because the source to do that was messy and big, and I just didnt know what I was doing haha

1534364466
DutchGh0st
I got my first programming class ... almost 2 years ago nearly now, started in Java (for school)

1534364515
DutchGh0st
then on my own I discovered python, sombody told me about Rust one day which I became really interested in, and somehow I stumbled upon Zig a few months ago

1534364569
unique_id
cool, I assume that most people dont travel far outside of java/c#/python

1534364603
DutchGh0st
because that's what they get in school, and thats where you can find jobs in

1534364671
DutchGh0st
I don't do Sofware Engineer currently at school, Im hoping to do so by the start of this years college, but if I ask my friend who does Software Engineer what the heap is, he does not know

1534364703

comptime is a bit difficult to reason about sometimes. part of the problem is that it is still pretty buggy. really powerful though when you start getting the hang of it.

1534364705
DutchGh0st
so...they dont get that stuff at my school? which is weird

1534365007
DutchGh0st
but I got to go! I'd like to see a bit of gameplay when your game is finished far enough unique_id !!

1534365042
DutchGh0st
have a nice day! byyee!

1534365149
unique_id
okay bye, and yes i will post stuff in a few months

1534365289
unique_id
Wow it sure is crucial to exit at the correct time out of a recursive MSD radix sort. It's the difference between it taking fractions of a millisecond and seconds! Whoops.

1534365342
unique_id
But I'll be using an LSD version probably. It's for sorting draw calls :)
