Anyone aware of something strange with release modes and @embedFile? I'm getting some as-of-yet inexplicable memory corruption, and while digging in to it I've managed to crash the compiler by taking a slice with constants, but it only happens in release builds.

...ok, @embedFile is not a requirement to produce the compiler crash at least

I think this is probably #955

1525706975
MajorLag1
Or maybe not. Problem seems slightly different in my project.

The good news is that whatever this is, it is definitely the cause of my texture corruption in release. Seems to be two separate issues, one involving taking a slice using constants and a different one involving @ptrCast

MajorLag1, nothing comes to mind yet. let me know if you come up with a test case

1525707642
MajorLag1
I added one to #955, but I think there might be a separate bug. One seems triggered by using slices with constant or literal start/end, and that one crashes compiler even in debug, but there's something with taking a ptrCast of global bytes that doesn't work right in release only.

1525707890
MajorLag1
It seems like it is related though... trying to come up with a test case for that part.

1525708716
MajorLag1
Huh. I can't seem to do better than crashing the compiler in the "only happens in release modes" case. Not sure why my code wouldn't crash and I instead just had corrupt data.

1525708977
MajorLag1
Anyway, both cases are in #955
