Has there been any discussion about golang style composition and implicit interfaces?

I find myself itching for a tiny layer of compile-time OOP without getting into runtime vtables

and userland implementations feel 2nd class (maybe with @reify this will no longer be the case)

If you're looking to avoid runtime vtable-like implementations then you should probably use comptime ducktyping. Otherwise I think this is the issue you're looking for:

Just out of curiosity, is there a gentoo overlay for Zig?

1530822512
andrewrk
not that I know of:

1530822526
andrewrk
if there is one, we should add it to this wiki page

stratact, why not use the static linux build?

1530822624
stratact
Sure, I could give that a try

1530822652
andrewrk
it's 100% static. guaranteed to work

1530822663
andrewrk
unzip & run

1530822710
stratact
andrewrk: gotcha, thanks for the convenience. Also, do you do nightly static builds?

1530822762
stratact
err, well "nightly" is a mozilla thing

1530822768
andrewrk
even better, it's every master branch commit that passes all tests

1530822773
stratact
awesome

why wait until night time? also what is nighttime? it's always daytime somewhere and we have users all over the world

1530822807
stratact
heheheh

1530822832

I guess night time for Rust means night during PT

1530822867
stratact
Anyway, awesome, much appreciated

andrewrk: does the zig binary also have an option to create projects, or do I have to manually create the structure myself?

1530823327
stratact
*file structure

1530823550
stratact
`zig build-exe`?

1530823748
andrewrk
zig build --init

1530823780
andrewrk
this can be improved:

1530823811
stratact
Yeah I like `zig init` or maybe `zig build-init`
