I found them, they are branches on the main zig repo,

Jeez the macros in this make everything complicated

1542157305

I followed the `DefaultRootWindow` rabithole and came out with `&((_XPrivDisplay(display))->screens[(_XPrivDisplay)(display)->default_screen->root)]`

I have no idea how I'm going to get past these macros with zig

1542158204
benjikun
wow, nevermind

1542158210
benjikun
they have function alternatives

andrewrk: around?

1542161437
daurnimator
Different beginner question (to anyone): what am I doing wrong here?

1542161627
presiden
daurnimator: from quick peek, first, probably the return value of the function

1542161653
daurnimator
presiden: I tried adding that. same error (error: expected token ';', found ',')

1542161661
presiden
daurnimator: fn sample() []f64 { ... }

1542161712
presiden
let me check

1542162371
presiden
daurnimator: something like this,

1542162423
daurnimator
presiden: that also fails with the same error for me. also I don't want to pre-declare the length

1542162635
presiden
or older version?

1542162646

I was using this arrays.zig:

1542162655
presiden
wokrs on 0.3.0

1542162907
presiden
I'm not so sure myself

1542163242
jfondren
presiden's code works for me on 0.3.0. Although the output's not so nice.

1542163255
jfondren
you can return 0 from main if you set its return type to u8

1542163560
presiden
sample() returning slice,

1542164094
jfondren
0.3.0

MajorLag: My intention was to (at comptime) concat arrays

concatenating arrays at compile-time:

benjikun
jfondren: stealth message?

1542164860
jfondren
I'm using sirc in tmux on a remote box for an IRC client, so usually I watch the logs rather than the client

1542164872
jfondren
but if it's bugged, eh.

1542164890
benjikun
weird

1542164918
jfondren
yeah. several messages in the last few minutes aren't in the log

1542164925
benjikun
strange

1542164962
benjikun
lol

1542165170
benjikun
is that wrong?

1542165205
jfondren
nah. it looks pretty good to me.

1542165238
jfondren
if ev.type were an enum, you could use a switch, and zig would error out if you missed a case.

1542165282
benjikun
but for some reason it doesn't work with dragging

1542165448
daurnimator
MajorLag: yeah that's not pretty :(

1542165491
daurnimator
disappointing that zig doesn't infer the array length for the return value

1542165616
benjikun
zig isn't a normal language heh

1542165807
benjikun
thank you :)

1542165807
MajorLag
bear in mind, I'm pretty much entirely ignorant of X api, so.

1542166051
benjikun
changed that, but still no cigar

1542166816
benjikun
hm

1542166932
daurnimator
okay, so now I've got further

1542167301
jfondren
damn this broken logger.

1542167647

MajorLag: I did `ButtonPressMask|ButtonReleaseMask|PointerMotionMask` instead now, still nothin :(

1542167717
daurnimator
you sure?

1542167770
MajorLag
pretty sure, I've run the compiler out of memory before

1542167899

hryx: I figured it was a good first-experiment

Awesome, good luck!

Hmmm. Anyone know of any good line-oriented formats that is able to represent structured data. So far, I've only found line-oriented XML and Fson formats (which might be good enough for my purposes).

1542205983

Motivation: I need to stream structured data between different process unix style

MajorLag
why serialize to a text format instead of a custom binary format? You can have a switch to render the output human readable. This would avoid the overhead cost of parsing it and rendering it at every stage in normal operation.

1542207988
MajorLag
Actually, don't even do a switch, just make a program that renders the input data and pipe the output to it.

1542222662

Hi again

1542227089

Hi benjikun, saw you got the wm working.

1542227095

yep :)

i feel like zig is the python of c

1542237630
jzelinskie
hard to describe why, but it feels right in my head

1542237638
benjikun
I don't see it that way

1542237660
jzelinskie
from a "language doesn't get in your way" perspective

1542237681
benjikun
hm

1542237759
jzelinskie
it's clear andy n co definitely start from a problem and come up with elegant solutions, rather than adding features because they think something will ben ice

1542237762
jzelinskie
be nice*

1542238223
benjikun
yeah, I like zig's scrupulous behavior in regards to new feature requests
