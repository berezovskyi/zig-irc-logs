anyone around?

wilsonk, hi

1516346805
wilsonk
zig build --build-file ../build.zig test  is giving me a segfault on Ubuntu 16.04 and I am not sure why?

1516346821
wilsonk
bt: Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. 0x0000000000f91236 in llvm::DenseMapInfo<unsigned int>::isEqual (LHS=@0x5: <error reading variable>,      RHS=@0x7fffffffcc60: 4294967295) at /usr/lib/llvm-5.0/include/llvm/ADT/DenseMapInfo.h:88 88    return LHS == RHS;

1516346855
wilsonk
I could pastebin the full output if that would help

1516346864
andrewrk
that would help

1516346872
wilsonk
ok, one second

1516346872
andrewrk
this is trying  to test the zig compiler?

1516346896
wilsonk
just following the build instructions for posix

1516346909
wilsonk
so: zig build --build-file ../build.zig test

1516346981
wilsonk


1516347049
andrewrk
hmm that's really strange. my best guess is that ubuntu has patched LLVM headers in an ABI-incompatible way

1516347086
wilsonk
hmm

1516347095
andrewrk
wilsonk, would you be willing to try these packages instead of the system ones?

1516347122
wilsonk
I posted an issue ten minutes ago that might be relevant, I suppose

1516347132
andrewrk
ah I see it

1516349659
wilsonk
wow, that is the first time I have screwed a linux system into the ground in a while!!  :(   I just accidently changed all the ownership permissions of my /bin and /etc directories to my user instead of root!! This could take a while to fix, since I can't sudo now  (and can't get root)!!! FAAAKKK

1516349796
wilsonk
I will have to reboot and probably won't be back for a bit andrewrk...I will check back in as soon as I can :(

1516349843
andrewrk
and that is why I recommend -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/local

Thank god this isn't a production system!

nice

Ok, I see what I did. I typed 'sudo make install' to install zig instead of just 'make install'...that is part of what confused me. Ok, now I have installed the clang version you recommended and things built without a problem but I am getting a new error when trying to run the tests. I will post it to the github issue

hi Hejsil

1516388018
Hejsil
Yo

1516388030
andrewrk
looks like you got to an exciting checkpoint in pokemon randomizer

1516388051
andrewrk
my girlfriend is into pokemon; I'm excited to show her a demo of your project when it's ready :)

1516388067
Hejsil
Nice :)

1516388117
Hejsil
If she likes randomized Pokemon roms, the Universal Randomizer exists though

1516388125
andrewrk
ahh

1516388138
andrewrk
what does your project plan to do differently?

1516388154
Hejsil
But the project seem to be dead now, soo~

1516388158
andrewrk
I see

1516388163
Hejsil
Well, I want to implement some "game modes"

1516388165
Hejsil
I have ideas

1516388188
Hejsil
But first, I wonna get the "fundamentals" done

1516388206
Hejsil
Randomizing trainers and wild mons

1516388213
andrewrk
cool

1516388306
Hejsil
Btw, you might want to find a way to test expressions in the docs. As far as I know, the example in the operator table under catch is wrong :)

1516388311
Hejsil
const value: %u32 = null;

1516388322
andrewrk
ahh, thanks. I was thinking about that

1516388348
Hejsil
but nice work on the doc testing

1516388353
Hejsil
That'll help it stay up to date

1516388364
andrewrk
that was so much work. I am exhausted

1516388370
Hejsil
lol

1516388419
andrewrk
and now I need to implement std.os code for directory listing for MacOS and Windows

1516388536
Hejsil
So you're gonna sit with 3 computers again?

1516388548
Hejsil
Or, i guess 2

1516388550
andrewrk
yes

1516388558
Hejsil
ooh boy

1516388559
andrewrk
3 because I have to run the tests on linux to make sure I didn't regress :)

1516388587
Hejsil
Well, have fun with that :)

1516391063
alexm_
hey guys can you define a function like this in zig "fn map2 (n : usize,items : [n]u8)->[n]u8" ?

1516391688
andrewrk
alexm_, yes, where `n` is a compile-time known value

1516391729
andrewrk
what is the function supposed to do?

1516391870
alexm_
im basically trying to write a function where you pass an array and a function and it applies the function to each element and returns a new array

1516391939
andrewrk
alexm_, of the same size?

1516391977
alexm_
yeah

1516391992
andrewrk
a new array, so you want the new one to be allocated on the heap?

1516392026
alexm_
yep

1516392048
alexm_
so applying fn(x:i32) -> i32{return x+1} to [1,2,3] will result in [2,3,4]

1516392163
andrewrk
just a sec

1516392424
andrewrk
alexm_, how about this?

1516392507
alexm_
great and the type of the array is also polymorphic

1516392536
andrewrk
and the size can be known at runtime

1516392538
alexm_
I'll try to write some more functional style programs in zig

1516392556
andrewrk
sounds challenging

1516392592
Hejsil
Well, he could write a garbage collection allocator and just use that in all of his code :)

1516392711
andrewrk
I know you're kidding, but I wonder how that would work

1516392725
andrewrk
what do you do about dangling pointers if you have a garbage collector in userland?

1516392756
Hejsil
Idk. I've never really written a garbage collector

1516392825
Hejsil
As far as I know, there exists userland garbage collectors in C, soo

1516392875
Hejsil
And a standard Mark and Sweep collector would move the memory around, soo no dangling pointers?

1516392879
Hejsil
Im not sure lol

1516392886
Hejsil
wouldn't

1516392887
Hejsil
*

1516392890
alexm_
yeah i know of a C/C++ garbage collector

1516392906
alexm_
its made by hans boehm

1516392953
Hejsil
andrewrk, linking against c standard lib on windows. Easiest way?

1516392976
Hejsil
In Zig that is

1516392977
andrewrk
Hejsil, I believe it should work out of the box, and all you need to do is `--library c`

1516393001
Hejsil
Well, I remember that not working at some point

1516393008
andrewrk
if it does not work now, it's a new bug

1516393016
Hejsil
And now i get "error: UncleanExit"

1516393025
Hejsil
And then no stacktrace

1516393029
Hejsil
Which we know why

1516393033
andrewrk
there should be something printed above that

1516393068
Hejsil
error: link failed

1516393092
andrewrk
and linker error messages?

1516393153
Hejsil


1516393156
Hejsil
All i get

1516393174
andrewrk
when I've run into errors like these on windows, I've had to use the llvm6 branch, because the windows debugging experience is better

1516393190
Hejsil
Hmm

1516393191
andrewrk
I think LLD is only giving us error: link failed, and in llvm 6 it gives better error messages

1516393210
Hejsil
Well, i guess it can wait

1516393234
andrewrk
what do you need --library c for ?

1516393242
Hejsil
std.heap.c_allocator

1516393267
andrewrk
can I suggest doing something like this, for now?

1516393286
andrewrk
I can work on a std lib heap allocator soon

1516393294
andrewrk
err, I mean a general purpose allocator

1516393297
Hejsil
Well, I guess I could allocate 500mb like that lol

1516393315
Hejsil
It's for the randomizer btw

1516393321
andrewrk
yeah

1516393348
andrewrk
it looks like llvm 6 will release on time, which is scheduled for feb 21

1516393350
Hejsil
Anyways. It was mostly to test my implementation of seekTo and getPos on windows in the std

1516393382
Hejsil
Because the randomizer uses those alot

1516393392
andrewrk
ahh

1516393436
Hejsil
Oooh, well. Did test it in some smaller code, and it seems to work. I'll probably just make a PR now

1516393445
andrewrk
:D

1516393448
Hejsil
:)

1516393494
Hejsil
Idk, if I handle all windows errors correctly. Couldn't find a source for what kind of errors you get from GetLastError after calling different functions

1516393531
Hejsil
Aka, errors from SetFilePointerEx

1516393536
andrewrk
I couldn't find that either for a lot of stuff, which is why I made that unexpectedErrorWindows function

1516393547
Hejsil
Ye, I just ended up using that too

1516393584
andrewrk
we almost can get rid of the dumpStackTrace part of it, since we have error return tracing

1516393608
andrewrk
...if we knew how to parse debug symbols on windows

1516393626
Hejsil
The struggle
