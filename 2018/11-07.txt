Finally got Zig to generate an executable for my ARM board.  Still have to check with binutils to make sure that things are where and what I expect.

diltsman, congrats. I'd be interested to see what roadblocks you had to overcome and make sure those issues have plans to resolve

if you have a socket, can you somehow read from it using a Stream?

also, pub fn readLine(buf: []u8) !usize { in std.io....it never closes stdin?

DutchGh0st
shouldn't it close it?

DutchGh0st, closing stdin is an uncommon use case. typically your program starts with it open, and ends with it open

really, there's no point in freeing memory or closing file handles when you exit anyway - the OS does it

I don't know if we have API for getting a stream from a socket, but it's definitely something that will work with the networking equivalent of std.os.File.OutStream / std.os.File.InStream

both of which are ~10 lines
