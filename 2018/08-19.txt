How much tool support is considered acceptable for being able to write and maintain zig? Like, with C the minimum viable tool support is mainly "a text editor and a compiler". But if we end up doing implicit typing for both function arguments and function return,s it will more or less require the text editor to be able to find all libraries and understand all zig code in order to maintain non-trivial zig code.

1534639574
tiehuis
Dirkson: my view would be no special tool support is required

1534639838
Dirkson
That'd be my ideal too, but I'm curious if we have an official Word From DevPerson about this.

1534640198

i would expect andrewrk to think the same given his programming environment but he can say when hes back

1534646633

Currently I haven't personally had much difficulty with just a text editor and the compiler, I hope it remains that way. I see the point about inferred return types but I think the trait, or more like "userland typechecking", proposal can help with that. I always felt a bit dirty taking "var", but after implementing a form of userland traits and typeclasses I feel much more comfortable with it. Making those checks

ould help.

good morning kristate

1534647178
kristate
hi!

1534647190
kristate
what time is it there?

1534647201
scientes
20:00

1534647314
kristate
not so bad -- how was your day?

1534647331
scientes
worked most of the day

1534647343
scientes
now i am wondering what I should work on programming-wise

1534647558
scientes
nice work on 1389

1534647793
kristate
thanks

1534647811
scientes
I feel i'm accumulating bugs in zig

1534647821
scientes
My cpp skills are not good enough to work on the compiler

1534647839
kristate
scientes: but you know C, right?

1534647843
scientes
yes

1534647864
scientes
i haven't looked at how much cpp is used

1534647890
kristate
C++ isn't so different -- the only thing you have to watch-out for are templates and decorators

1534647921
scientes
yeah but I look at simple C++ headers and my mind boggles, iterators for example

1534647931
kristate
exactly

1534647957
kristate
google's c++ guide is good. they don't allow most of their programmers to use all the featureset of c++

1534647966
scientes
although I do know enough to know that there are places where c can't be performant (but zig can) because of adherance to the C ABI

1534648003
kristate
I personally despise C++, but since LLVM is c++, it makes sense why andrewrk chose to use it

1534648034
kristate
the sooner we can move over to zig, the better

1534648041
scientes
go was implemented in C, and then they machine-translated it to go (but they never used macros)

1534648065
kristate
here is the guide:

1534648184
scientes
I had big disagreement with some of the review of my code. like the suggestion to not return arrays

1534648227
scientes
but thats just another zig bug

1534648248
scientes
anyways....

1534648302
kristate
scientes: wonder what it would take to fix this

1534648350
kristate
it looks like #770 was fixed

1534651010
scientes
comptime has the potential (with lots of work) to be very powerful

1534651020
scientes
like regular express compilation and execution

1534651060
scientes
but I wonder if an existing regular expression implementation can be modified to support comptime (and would non-zig code be acceptable to be integrated?)

1534654117
tiehuis
scientes: pretty sure we would only need a comptime allocator for this to be work:

1534659671
andrewrk
kristate, hi there

1534659676
kristate
andrewrk: hi

1534659693
kristate
how was your vacation?

1534659729
andrewrk
quite pleasant seeing my family. but now I'm ready to get back to work :)

1534659754
kristate
:)

1534659782
kristate
andrewrk: this BigInt stuff is crazy

1534659785
andrewrk
I'm going to focus on improving the stage1 compiler for the 0.3.0 release

1534659801
andrewrk
(starting with all the open PRs)

1534659808
kristate
andrewrk: thank-you!

1534659819
kristate
stage1 is not so bad -- I like it

1534660364
kristate
andrewrk: I am going to say something really weird -- but what if we start rewriting parts of stage1 in zig? kind of like a stage1.5

1534660404
kristate
andrewrk: BigInt needs a Big Overhaul

1534660414
andrewrk
I think that could make sense, as a transition. we will never lose stage1 though

1534660518
andrewrk
stage1 must be source, not output

1534660548
andrewrk
and it has to be able to build stage2 in 1 step

1534660560
kristate
andrewrk: yeah, more I think about it, doesn't make sense

1534660631
andrewrk
is it really that bad? I thought the problem was that it had a bunch of untested code paths

1534660736
kristate
twos_compliment is doing too much work

1534660794
kristate
we're only using BigInt in 87 places (outside of BigInt itself)

1534660815
andrewrk
I mean that logic has to go somewhere

1534660827
andrewrk
if you can refactor it to delete some lines of code, by all means, go for it

1534660848
kristate
andrewrk: yeah, about 2 hours into a patch

1534660855
andrewrk
cool

1534660864
andrewrk
I do need 1 more day of rest before I get back into it

1534660870
andrewrk
I'm about to get on a red eye flight

1534660876
andrewrk
talk to you later

1534660965
kristate
andrewrk: okay, sleep well! welcome back

1534703724
DutchGh0st
is there like a 'goto' concept in zig?

1534703831
scientes
DutchGh0st, yes, named breaks

1534703949
unique_id
I like goto myself, but I've not had a need for it in Zig because of 'named breaks'. Though in a rare case my code became a little bit more verbose.

1534703971
scientes
yeah i like both goto and VLAs and @alloca

1534704006
unique_id
What does the % do in Andrew's example on that page? I assume that syntax has been removed.

1534704007
DutchGh0st
a 'named' break just puts a lable on a loop-struct, and you break anywhere out of any loop?

1534704013
scientes
errdefer

1534704018
DutchGh0st
or am I completely wrong?

1534704029
scientes
yeah there was a de-mysterious-symbols movement in zig

1534704078
DutchGh0st
is it more or  less equal to the labeled breaks in Rust? or more powerfull?

1534704333
unique_id
I don't trust myself to answer questions on breaks, but the docs have some info and there's this:

1534704603
DutchGh0st
ah mhhh

1534704609
DutchGh0st
how is your game going btw??

1534705107
unique_id
I've been in learning mode for the last few days. I've been seeing how today's games implement particle systems, decals, etc. It's looking like my game will be going with what's called a tiled forward renderer. Basically you split your screen into tiles and use a compute shader to collect a list of things per tile. Like a list of lights, a list of decals, a list of particles. This makes things more efficient and it's a forward

1534705108
unique_id
shader which means I get MSAA.

1534705318
unique_id
Basically I'll be going with an architecture similar to what Doom did. But my game won't actually be heavy on graphics requirements though it will require a vulkan compatible card.

1534705391
unique_id
90% of steam users have DX12 supported card by now (a bit less for vulkan) and it'll increase rather quick. It'll definitely leave some people out sadly, but w/e.

1534705708
unique_id
(i don't know how many of those dx12 users are chinese playing through internet cafes....could be a lot)

1534705924
unique_id
I really need decals, I can't get them easily without tiled forward or deferred :)

1534706497
DutchGh0st
mhhh

1534706572
unique_id
DutchGh0st: decals are anything that's layed out directly onto anything without adding height. Text (possibly), blood splatter, explosion damage, etc

1534706596
DutchGh0st
ohhh I see

1534706620
DutchGh0st
seems all difficult to get good at haha

1534706732
unique_id
yeah I'm taking on a lot of roles that people usually specialize at. It takes a long time of being very confused until things start to make sense

1534707505
unique_id
DutchGh0st: I started reading about deferred shading 2 years ago, it was only recently that I began to understand them. I could of course just use a ready-made game engine but had I done that I'd be a skilless game developer with a tool much too powerful for me. And I'd pick the same strategies that the largest studios employ. I'd depend on an animator for animations instead of learning math tricks to reduce the number of

1534707507
unique_id
keyframes required, allowing programmer animations :)

1534707562
unique_id
So for me picking a game engine is no shortcut. Learning how everything works is inevitably going to make me a better developer, with a much better understanding of what's possible

1534707562
DutchGh0st
I remember I had to make a game for highschool

1534707569
DutchGh0st
we had like 3 teams

1534707582
DutchGh0st
the animators or whatever, the map creators, and the programmers

1534707597
DutchGh0st
note: We had never programmed anything before

1534707604
scientes
is there some sample code that uses the new tcp stuff?

1534707663
DutchGh0st
and like after a while the animators and map creators had like all these maps an animations and whatnot.....and it was just a hard job for me and the rest of the programmers to put everything together well

1534707758
unique_id
yeah that's understandable. They're creating everything in isolation, in their little tools. The whole game is then left

1534707769
DutchGh0st
I wonder what we could have produced if we'd gotten propper lessons

1534707842
DutchGh0st
cuz it at the start of the year it was like 'youuu gotta make 2 games. They've to be finished in like 6 months. Goodluck'

1534708626
scientes
thats horrible teaching

1534708632
scientes
you need smaller projects than that

1534709525
DutchGh0st
yes!

1534709557
DutchGh0st
we had 2 crappy games at the end

1534709573
scientes
like my command-not-found implementation

1534716686
scientes
how do i implement non-blocking io with async?

1534717097
scientes
i'm getting error.WouldBlock when i try to read

1534717205
scientes
but its in a async thread, I want it to block

1534719621
scientes
I need an example of how to use EventFd

1534719627
scientes
there are no tests

1534719713
scientes
I don't know how to call read with event.loop

1534721722
scientes
and why is it pread with a v--vector?
