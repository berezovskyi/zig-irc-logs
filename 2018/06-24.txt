I'm getting a segfault when the C library I'm working with invokes the callback I pass to it, here's the relevant snippit of a valgrind run:

@andrewrk Would it be resonble to allow numeric values @ptrCast'ed to [*]const u8 at comptime to generate a pointer to memory of size @sizeOf(integer_type)?

1529802762
alexnask
This would couls also allow @bitCast ing the values

I've seen some people trying to do similar things at comptime lately, I'm pretty torn about wether it should be allowed or not personally

I'm guessing a major deterant is people thinking that the byte representation at comptime is the same as at runtime

[zig] isaachier opened pull request #1157: Add fuzz test (master...fuzz-test)

I'm working on making Zig on an msp430 work nicely and have a question: What I need is for a user to type P1OUT and have the emitted assembly actually say PAOUT_H in it's place.

In C that would be the preprocessor, I'm not sure how to do it in Zig though. It's critical that the name actually gets translated as a linker script is providing the final value.

I'm trying to get a smooth usage out of the TI provided headers and linker scripts and such. LLVM actually makes calls to libgcc for the MSP430 backend.

@importC isn't working on this header.

Oops have to go. If anyone is interested, it is at:

There's no readme yet.

Ugh... comptime and it's caching of type values....

1529870864
MajorLag1
no, wait, this time it's cachine a function return I think

1529870929
MajorLag1
yeah, in an inline for loop

1529871725
MajorLag1
...nevermind, even without the function it is still caching something it shouldn't.

1529871762
MajorLag1
Accoding to the output, the passed in var has a field that isn't a slice, but has typeName []u8. Way to go.

1529871974
MajorLag1
It seems to be caching the result of any switch or if statement.

1529872015
MajorLag1
But only in functions that are a few calls deep.

Pretty sure it's #906 again
