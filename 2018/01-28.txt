andrewrk: i wouldn't suggest using regex to match urls, not even paths

perhaps a special syntax might work, something like: `/user/{userid:\d+}`

but even though, it's better imho if the user does the validation, not a regex, you get more meaningful error messages this way

andrewrk: I can reliably crash the compiler trying to @ptrCast to a ?&const c_void. Is it known?

*a known bug

seems to be caused by the source ptr being related to a const. In my code, it's a var in an empty struct, but testing shows that casting from any const works.
