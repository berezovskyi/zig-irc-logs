how do i open a file? i used to do std.io.File.openRead, but now i'm getting an error that std.io.File is private.

seems like an oversight, since getStdOut() is pub and returns a File.

oh, it's just std.os.File.

Yeah I think io is for the higher level interfaces to IO, and it's just importing File as a toplevel (private) constant from std.os

it does seem weird that getStdOut() / getStdIn() / getStdErr() are defined there instead of os

hobomatic, you're right, they should be moved

if anyone has strong opinions or ideas on it and/or arg parsing feel free to leave some comments/suggestions

the existing one was a pain to add new commands so i think this style works better and better describes applicable options for each command
