there is no address. no machine code is generated for 0 bit types

about to write a reply comment, but I really think u0 is in search of a problem where there is none

1537250487

Could be, but if u0 can be "properly" defined and works "as expected" I think its fine.

1537250510
kristate
wink_: I think it's like that pony language defining 1/0=0

1537250541
kristate
it's going to hide bugs, especially allowing @atomicRmw to be a noop

1537250555

yeah, I thought that was funny too.

1537250557
kristate
if you need u0, something is seriously wrong

kristate,

At the moment I have no immediate need but it just seems it could work.

1537250639
kristate
wink_: yeah, that's what makes it dangerous. NULL was the same way apparently

kristate
it just

1537250682
scientes
NULL was a good idea, zig just does it better

1537250684

This is pre 1.0 and I think experiments are fine.

1537250736
kristate
wink_: I think that I am of that way, but I did not like andrewrk's attitude that he could not defend u0 but tried to force me to say what was wrong with it.

In the end someone has to make a decision to make progress, mistakes will be made but that's ok. Fail fast is a good thing :)

gtg, getting up early. Cheers.

Just stumbled onto this u0 debate (late I realize :) ).  If zig is going to be really close to bare metal then there might be one use case for such a type (maybe). Ethernet technically transmits states 0, [ nothing ] and 1...so NOT just 0 and 1. This is because there needs to be a positive or negative voltage difference to produce the 0 or 1...nothing is the neutral state and is a state that needs to be there to avoid bias (i

1537252894
wilsonk
e. too many 0's or 1's in a row produce bias). Perhaps a language that can represent this state would be useful, even if only as a no-op...basically? Or perhaps only as a theoretical type that code-gens to nothing?

Anyways, just my two bits. ( pun intended :) )

I might also be talking out my butt, because I am trying to recall old CompSci information stuffed deep down in the old medula oblongata!!! Take with a grain of salt please ;)

how/where does @import happen in the compiler?

andrewrk, Seems bytesToSlice broke:

1537277522
andrewrk
Hejsil, I'll fix it, thanks

1537277567
andrewrk
scientes, zig's allocator interface when asked for 0 bytes returns undefined sliced from 0..0

1537277594
andrewrk
so we don't even have to deal with this malloc issue, because we have slices

kristate: It is not acceptable to characterize #1530 as "andrewrk could not defend u0". I would like you to take a break from Zig for a week, and then come back when you're ready to interact in an honest, positive, and open-minded way.
