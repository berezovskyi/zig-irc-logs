andrewrk, if i run into a compiler crash that i can't isolate, would it be ok to just make a branch in my project and create an issue linking to it?

1535612358
dbandstra
in the odd chance that someone familiar with the compiler could set a breakpoint and figure it out in a few minutes, instead of me trying to blindly disable and enable zig code

@andrewrk do you have a priority list of desired libraries anywhere?

1535629218

I was thinking a good way to get familiar with Zig might be to write a Flatbuffers port.

1535629244
bodie_
It could be a lot of work and I don't have much spare time so I figured maybe there's something else that might be more interesting.

how do I check if a struct has a method or not?

bodie_, why not capnproto

1535635017
scientes
(therew are so many serialization protocols)

DutchGh0st: here's a relevent section of my WIP trait library:

1535635109
scientes
ahh, it looks tlike they have many similarities

1535635157
MajorLag
oops, looks like I missed including two necessary functions:

1535635477
scientes
bodie_, i'm waitng on kristate to post his Udp (and tcp? patches) before I try to get tcp zero copy working on linux

1535635560
kristate
yes, and I am waiting for 0.3.0 and #1364

1535635564
kristate


1535635640
scientes
the test are also run in serial

1535635647
scientes
i was thinking of trying to make them parallel

1535635680
kristate
udp and tcp are 0.4.0, so we need to get 0.3.0 out first

1535636695
DutchGh0st
I see MajorLag

1535636722
DutchGh0st
but here's the thing, I have a 'Trait', and based on a condition, a function should be part of that 'Trait'

1535636736
DutchGh0st
and if the condition is not met, the function should be part of it

1535637939
MajorLag
If I assume you meant "not be part of it" if the condition is not met, then: `if(condition and comptime hasFn("fnName"))` should work, shouldn't it?

1535658000
andrewrk
scientes, kristate: by all means work on 0.4.0 and beyond issues

1535658037
andrewrk
that milestone just means that I will personally spend my time on 0.3.0 issues

1535658048
andrewrk
scientes, apologies for not getting to your arm stuff yet

1535658073
andrewrk
I'd like to focus on windows stack traces for a couple more days

1535672959
andrewrk
dbandstra, in answer to your question, yes, I would debug a branch in your open source project if it was crashing the compiler

1535672990
andrewrk
bodie_, that's a good question. I'll compile such a list. can you remind me in a week or two if I forget?

1535673072
andrewrk
MajorLag, how do you usually run zig? zig build? zig build-exe directly? from an editor? cmd.exe? powershell? mingw?

1535673425
andrewrk
hmm you know what would be pretty neat in std.fmt is a hex dumper
