andrewrk, is there somewhere to get the latest zig binary for linux? I don't need any packaging, just the binary is fine since it looks like Zig is pretty trivial to package as an AppDir.

andrewrk
MajorLag2, no, that doesn't exist anywhere yet

here's a related issue:

1521402822
MajorLag
andrewrk, so travis ci creates a complete binary, but it isn't made available anywhere like the apveyor artifact is for Windows? According to the AppImage people, a lot of projects have scripts to produce AppImages from travis ci builds. From what I can tell this should be trivial for Zig, since the binary has so few runtime dependencies. I already made an AppDir of an older version using a binary ripped from the D

1521402822
MajorLag
ack at it but I don't know anything about travis ci.

1521402881
andrewrk
I'm looking up what AppImage is

1521402884
cgag
i'm gettiing `lld: error: cannot open /home/cgag/src/zig/libstdc++.a: No such file or directory` while trying to run `./zig build --build-file ../build.zig test` from the zig build directory as per the readme

1521402921
cgag
not really sure wy it's looking there?  i don't see any libstdc++ in any zig subdir, though i do have it in /usr/lib64

1521402925
andrewrk
cgag, can I see more output?

1521402948
MajorLag
Sounds like the LIB_DIR path isn't set right.

andrewrk
cgag, what linux distro is this?

1521403323
cgag
fedora 27, llvm and clang 6 build from source, no llvm or clang packages installed

1521403413
andrewrk
MajorLag, I just had a look at AppImage. the example from their home page does not work on NixOS, my linux distro. Even when I fixed the path to the dynamic linker, it expected a library to be installed that was not installed. I'm not convinced AppImage is the best solution to this problem

1521403434
andrewrk
I'd be more interested in trying to produce a static build of zig

1521403489
MajorLag
That's a bit surprising, but I know they've had issues with Nix before. I agree about the static build though.

1521403520
andrewrk
cgag, what does this output for you: cc -print-file-name=libstdc++.a

1521403540
cgag
just `libstdc++.a`

1521403588
andrewrk
ok, what's going on here is that the build script tried the above command to figure out where libstdc++.a is on your system, and it didn't work. and then instead of reporting that error, it tried to use the wrong path

1521403609
andrewrk
I'll fix the second part to make the problem clearer, and meanwhile we can try to figure out a better way to determine where that file is on your system

1521403640
andrewrk
does it work if you replace `cc` with `c++` ?

1521403833
cgag
ah, makes sense. same output from `c++`

1521403849
cgag
gcc 7.3.1

1521404308
andrewrk
cgag, I reproduced the problem on a VPS. I can see that the file is at /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/7/32/libstdc++.a even though -print-file-name does not find it

1521404838
cgag
i also see it just at /usr/lib and /usr/lib64

1521405218
andrewrk
cgag, can you try the fedora-build branch and see if that solves the issue for you?

1521405492
cgag
`Unable to find zig lib directory. Reinstall Zig or use --zig-install-prefix.`

1521405508
andrewrk
did you remember to make install?

1521405560
cgag
no :\

1521405586
cgag
`lld: error: cannot open /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/7/32/libstdc++.a: No such file or directory`

1521405601
andrewrk
that file does not exist for you?

1521405658
cgag
it appears to be a symlink to /usr/lib/libstdc++.a

1521405687
cgag
actually, one minute

1521405778
cgag
it looks like it's a broken symlink to /usr/lib/gcc/i686-redhat-linux/7/libstdc++.a, and that i686 folder doesn't exist

1521405855
andrewrk
is there a valid libstdc++.a file anywhere on your system?

1521405894
cgag
just searched and can't find one, only see .so

1521406115
andrewrk
cgag, what does this do?

1521406660
andrewrk
cgag, can you also try `yum install libstdc++-static` with master branch?

1521407871
andrewrk
cgag, here's an issue to track self hosted compiler build on fedora:

1521409480
MajorLag
even the nix package isn't up to date...

1521409654
cgag
awesome, looks like libstdc++-static fixed it, thanks a bunch

1521411450
andrewrk
cgag, thanks for the report. I'll update the build script to inform fedora users of this

1521411485
andrewrk
MajorLag, of zig?

1521411587
MajorLag
yeah
