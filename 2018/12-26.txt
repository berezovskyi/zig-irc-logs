has anybody tried to get zig programs working a tomu?

(tiny ARM board)

1545786105

its arch seems to be armv6m

1545786157
oats
which zig seems to be able to target, but I'm not sure if I can/should include the firmware that's used in the sample projects

1545786181
oats
which is hindered by the fact that I don't understand the sample projects

1545786197
oats
s/firmware/firmware libraries

1545786256
oats
I'm also thinking about just ditching the libraries entirely and seeing if I could write my own for fun

1545786285
oats
I've also never done stuff this low-level, so my knowledge level is pretty low here

oats: I think andrewrk has a small game running on raw hardware that is Arm based (Raspberry Pi, I think). He is probably the best one to ask when he is online...

1545794355

oh that's cool

wilsonk: thanks :)

I've never written stuff for microprocessors before

although I'm taking a class in microprocessors this semester I'm very much looking forward to

When using `--emit asm` is there a way to change where the assembly file is saved?

I am still struggling with strings. How do I pass a string to a function, without the first character? I'm betting on pointer addition, but I can't quite figure it out

Slices:

1545835495
IntoxicatedHippo
You could do something like string[1..]

1545836327
Zaab1t
thanks IntoxicatedHippo

1545836359
Zaab1t
I can't seem to find the regular for loop in the docs. Does Zig only have for each loops?

1545837851
unique_id
Zaab1t: That's a common question. For now people use "var i: usize = 0; while(i < count) : (i+=1)" I believe people have been talking about getting an alternative, don't know more.

1545837871
Zaab1t
thats what I do too for now

1545837887
Zaab1t
figured there might be some range type

1545837893
Zaab1t
[0..15]

1545837902
Zaab1t
a slice of nothin'

1545837913
unique_id
right

1545837932
unique_id
I've seen people talking about having something like that

1545837950
unique_id
wanting to*

1545838046
Zaab1t
unique_id: do I need to handle to potential overflow?

1545838123
unique_id
for on ranges:

1545838152
unique_id
Zaab1t: I don't understand the question

1545838461
Zaab1t
excuse my stupidity

1545838482
Zaab1t
unique_id: I was referring to the i+=1, but its not relevant anymore

1545838585
Zaab1t
so I have a function that takes a string, str: []const u8

1545838597
Zaab1t
it needs to handle the special case, where str.len == 1

1545838618
Zaab1t
compiler says:  integer value 1 cannot be implicitly casted to type '*const u8'

1545839009
Zaab1t
alright, && is not the and operator

1545839301
unique_id
an integer can't be implicitly cast to a pointer, that makes sense :)

1545839438
unique_id
are you comparing str.ptr instead of str.len?

1545839445
unique_id
wait no, str.ptr is probably of type [*]const u8

1545839462
Zaab1t
I was using && as logical and

1545839499
unique_id
oh that's the same issue not a separate one, ok :)

I am working on the 'contributor-friendly' isse 1768. Is it possible in the test suite to tell the compiler to expect an error?

Also, I

I've never done contributed to an open source project before. I forked the repo, am making my change in a branch, and then will make a pull request. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any social pleasantries/ manners to observe?

I'll just go for it before my kids get home.

andrewrk: yeah, I will send a pr... but there's one last thing that is hindering me

tthe test-cli are faliling but only on CI
