sorry about the d/c spam, something's up with my bouncer

I just tried compiling zig on github and am getting compile errors when trying to compile lld. I am on fedora 28 with llvm/clang/lld 6.0, cmake 3.11 and am compiling with gcc version 8.0

1526403003
AX31
I am going to try compiling with clang and see if I am still getting the same error.

1526403055
andrewrk
hi AX31, unless you're trying to submit a patch to zig I suggest using the static binary

1526403065
andrewrk


1526403080
andrewrk
it's automatically built from master when all tests pass in CI

1526403364
AX31
Thanks for the quick reponse. I do want to help contribute to zig so I would like be able to build the compiler from source. Compiling with clang does seem to work though.

1526403438
AX31
I mainly just posted to see if this was a known problem.

1526403472
andrewrk
it was unknown - thanks for the report. do you have a paste of the errors handy?

For some reason gcc complains that the class "Symbol" does not have trivial copy assignment but clang is fine with it.

1526403983
andrewrk
AX31, I wonder if fedora 28 has an LDD patch to work around this

1526404012
andrewrk
presumably there's an LLD 6.0 package in fedora 28 that was built with gcc 8.0, right?

1526404061
AX31
yeah, there is

1526404219
andrewrk
hm there appears to be no patch for this

1526404251
AX31
Is it nessecary to use the version of lld in the zig source tree?

1526404266
andrewrk
yes, zig has 2 patches

1526404273
andrewrk
one of which is upstream

1526404297
andrewrk
there's an open issue for the other one:

1526404522
darithorn
if you use @typeInfo outside of a comptime block all the compiler outputs is "unreachable", along with a stack trace. is there a plan for better error messages in the future?

1526404613
andrewrk
AX31, try this patch:

1526404624
andrewrk
if it makes the build succeed for you using gcc 8.0 I'll push it to master

1526404634
andrewrk
darithorn, that's the compiler crashing

1526404639
andrewrk
it's planned for the compiler to not crash :)

1526404662
darithorn
haha yeah, the compiler not crashing would be good ;)

1526404735
andrewrk
darithorn, do you have a small test case for this?

1526404826
andrewrk
darithorn, do you have a small test case for this?

1526404831
andrewrk
oops

1526404842
darithorn
doing: var info = @typeInfo(Foo); instead of comptime var info = @typeInfo(Foo); will make it crash

1526404866
andrewrk
ok cool. I'll fix that. that's supposed to give you a compile error because you used `var` instead of `const`

1526404879
andrewrk
(or comptime var as you mentioned)

1526404891
darithorn
actuall using const instead of var makes it crash too

1526404941
darithorn
comptime const foo = @typeInfo(Foo); won't make it crash

1526405097
andrewrk
darithorn, I'm unable to reproduce your results. can you make a test case?

1526405111
AX31
@andrewrk that patch worked, thanks!

1526405135
darithorn
hm, i built zig yesterday from master. i'll mess around with it

[zig] andrewrk opened pull request #1013: build: add flag to LLD to fix gcc 8 build (master...gcc8)

1526405304
andrewrk
AX31, ^ when that passes the CI tests I'll merge it

1526406381
darithorn
andrewrk, I tried the prebuilt zig binary from zig-lang.com and it crashes as well. I boiled it down to a named struct with fields:

1526406398
darithorn
er ziglang.com

1526406411
andrewrk
thanks! I'll have a look

1526406417
darithorn
oh it's a .org my bad

1526406442
andrewrk
don't worry, you didn't make me forget where ziglang.org is :)

1526406513
andrewrk
darithorn, I reproduced your results

1526406580
darithorn
sweet, btw it happens with anonymous struct with fields as well, it's not just it being a named struct

darithorn
when i try to use the c_allocator i get an lld error "duplicate symbol: _start". is that one of the known lld issues?

1526421714
darithorn
using the debug global allocator works just fine

1526421891
darithorn
nevermind i found the issue. i forgot to link libc. weird error though

1526422551
andrewrk
unfortunately there's not much we can do about that

1526422570
andrewrk
there are use cases for not doing --library c and still using c_allocator

1526422575
andrewrk
so we can't make it an error
