Is there a way or are there plans for a way to have a convenience for unwrap nullable types with a "for"? I've been doing a lot of "for (array) |nullt| { if (nullt) |t| { do_something(t); } }" and it might be nice to have for skip the nulls and give me an unwrapped type somehow (e.g. for (array) |??t|) or something
