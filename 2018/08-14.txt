unique_id
What's the best way to divide two integers such that any remainder adds 1 to the result?

1534271629

Bug: const ptr: [*]u64 = &integers; where integers is a const array.

You're welcome to file this on github (i dont have an account) if it hasn't already been filed

also works to do: foobar(&integers) where foobar takes [*]u64 and integers is const array
