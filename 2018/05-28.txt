Syntax/grammar question: why does Zig have the 'fn' keyword? For easy linear reading? Does it need it for unambiguous grammar?

I just learned that Dart eschewed a special keyword for function definitions. Also, see

...to make Zig feel 'familiar'?

_0joshuaolson1, it's to have trivially unambiguous syntax

Is it considered a format crime to replace 'fn foo() void {' with 'fn foo () void {'?  The former looks a bit like a function call, like putting 'if(...)' instead of 'if (...)'.

n_1-c_k, this sounds like a good discussion for #1003

currently the formatter will rewrite that example to the former
