why does that crash, with an 'integer overflow' ?

1538908407
DutchGh0st
and how do I fix it?

andrewrk: , @typeName(resume) segfaults I think

1538938572
DutchGh0st
Ill run gdb over it

1538938591
DutchGh0st
@typeName(return) gives just a normal error at comptime

1538938600
DutchGh0st
resume should do the same

Hi all. I'm new to Zig and wonder what the |x| syntax means. Is it the same as Rust's closures or Crystal's blocks?

1538940715
DutchGh0st
it captures, yes

1538940726
DutchGh0st
for(array) |item| {}

1538940739
DutchGh0st
for(array) |*item| {} <-- this gives pointers

1538940781
DutchGh0st
and couldn't you give a closure to the `catch` statement?

1538940802
DutchGh0st
and to arms of the switch statements, usefull for switching on unions

Is there a tutorial or introduction to Zig available somewhere? The official documentation seems to consist of examples only.

1538941049
darithorn
it's also good for nulls

1538941064
darithorn
if (nullableVar) |notNull| {}

1538941144
DutchGh0st

there's not really any official tutorial besides those examples, and be wary of any older tutorial because zig has gone through a few syntax changes since they've been written

Thank you. I'll check out the examples and come back if something is not clear to me :)

How did you get to know zig, josh3?

I am looking for an alternative to C, but I need the Xlib and Xt libraries (C bindings). I found Zig on

1538941836
DutchGh0st
ah okey!

1538941867
DutchGh0st
I have not called C functions in Zig yet

1538941875
DutchGh0st
I have called Zig from Rust tho hahaha

1538941917
DutchGh0st
well, Zig compiled to a .lib file, and than importing that in Rust again, so it all works with the C abi
