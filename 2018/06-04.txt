I saw a discussion in here and I'd like to be explicit, does dot syntax dereference pointers completely?

1528073970
mreiland
a.b will do the right thing whether a is a value or a pointer or a double pointer?

1528073975
mreiland
am I understanding that correctly?

1528074175
andrewrk
mreiland, we now have single-item pointers - *T -  and unknown-length pointers - [*]T

1528074198
andrewrk
for single-item pointers, field access can do 1 dereference

1528074208
andrewrk
for unknown length pointers, field access cannot deref

1528074329
mreiland
alright, thanks

1528074343
mreiland
did you see the note yesterday about the 301 redirects on the download page causing issues?

1528074391
mreiland
the download link is issuing a 301 which is moved permanently and it's causing browsers to cache so that when a person tries to download a new version of master the browser doesn't see it

1528074413
mreiland
that should probably be a 307 I believe (moved temporarily).  just thought I'd mention it in case you didn't see it

1528074427
mreiland
I think that's the proper status code for it

1528074465
mreiland
in addition the date-modified header is wrong, it's showing 5/23, but my understanding is that it was updated a day or so ago

1528075301
andrewrk
mreiland, are you referring to this link?

1528075500
andrewrk
damn, I don't think s3 lets you make the redirect non-301

1528075607
mreiland
yes, that's the link

1528075633
mreiland
it's still trying to pull down 0.2.0.717ac85a.tar.xz, I had to pull it up in a private window to get the latest

1528075639
mreiland
without forcing FF to flush caches

1528075662
andrewrk
looks like it's possible. I have to jump through a bunch of hoops to get the redirect code to be non-301

1528075666
andrewrk
I'll make an issue

1528075711
mreiland
I'm not an expert on browser caching behavior, but I believe the date-modified isn't correct and I know my browser was sending the if-modified-since header when it made the request

1528075744
mreiland
so it could be simply that the date-modified header needs to be correct and then the browsers will start grabbing the latest version appropriately

1528075783
andrewrk


1528076667
mreiland
I added a note about the last-modified and if-modified-since headers

1528076792
andrewrk
thanks

1528076832
andrewrk


1528076843
andrewrk
that's where it uploads the file. I guess the clock could be wrong on travis ci

1528077785
mreiland
I did a little more investigation and updated that issue.  I'm not really familiar with S3 or your setup so it's all just WAG's, but hopefully it's helpful

1528078306
andrewrk
thanks!

Well anyways, currently even `C:\zig\zig build` fails, and you need to be explicit and type `C:\zig\zig.exe build` for it to work

1528093316

Thank you. Also I think this should have a newline after `file not found`              ->                 `unable to open 'C:\Users\alpha\Desktop\s\src\main.zig': file not foundThe following command exited with error code 1:`

Hi

1528099803
kristate
I'm hooked on zig and want to know what I can do to help

1528110955
MajorLag2
kristate, there's a lot of things. If you look at github userland issues, for instance. We can always use improvements to the std library as well. Oh, and win32 is in desperate need of someone to tackle coff/pdb stack traces.

1528111683
alpha
Is code written in zig supposed to segfault?

1528111738
MajorLag2
generally not. is it a compiler segfault or your program?

1528111743
alpha
program

1528111811
MajorLag2
zig has runtime protections to catch many kinds of problems in debug/release-safe builds, but doesn't catch everything.

1528111862
MajorLag2
do you have a code snippet of what's causing the segfault?

1528111907
alpha
The code is big right now. Will try to find the exact cause

1528112351
alpha


1528112528
MajorLag2
`const c = ComplexType { .NotOk = {} };`

1528112565
MajorLag2
or `const c = ComplexType { .NotOk = void{} };` to make it more obvious

1528112621
alpha
Thank you

1528118235

Why does this

It would be good to print getLastError() message before crashing on windows. Some context is better than no context.

idk why compiler thinks s needs to be a u6. what is going on?

1528132813
clownpriest
error output at the bottom

1528132983
andrewrk
clownpriest, the type system is enforcing that you do not invoke undefined behavior when using the shift operator

1528133015
andrewrk
I believe this should fix it: var s: u6 = 0;

1528133117
andrewrk
in C it's undefined behavior if you shift by a number equal to or larger than the number of bits in the left operand

1528133157
clownpriest
that makes sense

1528133165
clownpriest
thank you

1528133412
clownpriest
yes!

1528133421
clownpriest
didn't realize it was already in the stdlib

1528133486

should have looked more closely

1528133520

it's private - I would need to clean it up, make it public, and move it to std.dwarf

it's no rush, at least for me

1528141992

nah, just wondering is there were some generic functions available in stdlib

1528142008
clownpriest
if there*

1528142131
clownpriest
something like to_slice(data: [n]T)

1528142366

why would you use that instead of foo[0..] ?

1528142522

no good reason, just personal aesthetics

I think you would be fighting an uphill battle to try avoiding the core language syntax
