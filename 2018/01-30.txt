i thought Go was, like, Java-level

Totally possible. It's got a garbage collector, but it's a compiled language (statically by default even).

You can just call syscalls directly.

So I have an index out of bounds error somewhere, but it's not consistent. What's the best way I can debug this currently? On Win64.

1517330383

MajorLag_, the best way is to use the llvm6 branch

1517330409

because of

1517330440

llvm 6 is scheduled to be released feb 21, then we can merge llvm6 branch into master

1517330455
andrewrk
if you do that you can debug with MSVC

Is there a reason the safety check can't include more information?

1517331568
andrewrk
on linux it includes a full backtrace

1517331574

windows is waiting on

1517331588
andrewrk
is there another piece of info we could include?

1517332673
MajorLag_
If possible, a source line number would help. Or even just the name of the function it occurred in. I get that it only comes up because of the lack of debug info in this instance.

Is there a way to get a float type's epsilon like there is an int type's min/max?

1517333691
andrewrk
I think we have some constants in std.math

are you working on a game?

More of a toy, just to feel out the language.

Though I have always wanted to make a real game out of a wolf3d-style raycasting engine...
