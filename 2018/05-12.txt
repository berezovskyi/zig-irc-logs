sounds like accessing the path from the COFF section is more reliable\

what's the best file to look at for understanding how typeInfo is structured?

1526086713
andrewrk
MajorLag, look at zig-cache/builtin.zig

oh cool, I don't have to read cpp

hmm.. unfortunately it seems like typeinfo has some issues. Haven't managed to get it to not segfault.

Think I have it narrowed down.

Hello

Does there exist an opengl wrapper for zig? Like

Skilfingr: I think someone mentioned writing a loader for OpenGL functions, but I don't recall who it was.

Skilfingr, you can use a C library, e.g. epoxy

here's an example:

a pure zig library would be neat, but does not exist yet as far as I'm aware

Skilfingr
Thanks. How is the pointer-reform going? Should I wait for this to finish before playing with zig?

1526152421
andrewrk
Skilfingr, I think that's kind of the same question as, should you wait for 1.0.0 to play with zig

1526152462
andrewrk
my answer is: if you want to be more of an end user, wait until 1.0.0. If you're happy to be a beta user where you participate in the development process, then you should jump in and start using master branch

1526152669
Skilfingr
haha, thats true :)

What is your strategy for 1.0? Do you have a timeline or bulletlist of features? Or is it more like when its done its done?

1526153949
andrewrk
Skilfingr, if you look at the issues on github, they all have a milestone. any issue with a milestone <= 1.0.0 is blocking the release of 1.0.0

1526153960
andrewrk
(which is most issues)

1526154044
Skilfingr
ok

1526154536
andrewrk
I predict 1.0.0 in 2 years
