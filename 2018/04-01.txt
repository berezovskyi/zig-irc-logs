How are things coming with automating the linux-static artifact generation? I see that it turns out libxml2 is unnecessary in llvm, which is great but it takes me 20 hours to recompile llvm. If we're expecting to have an easily accessible artifact for latest like we do for windows within the week, then I don't think I need to bother.
