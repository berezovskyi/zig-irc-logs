Do you want to chat about parser formalisms sometime? I have a bit of experience with PEGs

I'm the primary author of the longform docs for a Rust PEG library

Sure thing, though I'm not expect on the matter. Just good enough to put it to action.

Also, decided that I'd go for a context free grammar, as I've read and agreed that PEGs hide syntactics flaws.

Not a bad idea. The best languages are LR(k), and that's tricky to verify with PEGs
