I'm having an issue with applying an operator like "|=" to a dereferenced pointer

1530236091
vegecode
"|=" operator:

1530236113
vegecode
just a "=" operator for comparison :

andrewrk, I started but haven't finished yet one of your youtube videos where you were talking about the compiler pipeline, which is why I'm trying to look at the IR now

1530236175
vegecode
I appreciate the videos!

1530236213

In the "|=" operator IR, is it trying to dereference the pointer twice?

1530236378
vegecode
I have no idea. Should this be a bug report on github?

Actually the same issue happens even if you don't use the "|=" operator and break it out into myP.* = myP.* | 10;

i'm gonna' build from source, probably, just curious =)

varion, have you seen the CI builds of master branch?

yeah, i saw they existed. it just seems like a lot of my other interests are making their way to scoop, since it's so minimal =) nim, etc.

andrewrk, quick suggestion... I enjoyed your YouTube video about the zig compiler internals. I would also be interested to see one where you basically program on camera, fix a bug and explain your thought process and such.

vegecode, thanks! I plan to get into a routine doing some of that after I get back from traveling

another question about "blk: { <stuff>; break :blk <expression>; }"

1530307936
v1bri
why use the "blk:" label and not just "const num1 = { var val1: i32 = 99; val1 = val1 + 1; break val1; };" for example

v1bri, because if the block was in a loop, it would be confusing and ambiguous whether the break applies to the loop or the block
