Hi there

1523163667
heakins
Is there a way to set the evalBranchQuota from the command line instead of using the BuiltIn function @setEvalBranchQuota?

1523163719
heakins
I have a line "const table = gen_table();" which is causing evaluation to exceed 1000 backwards branches

1523163782
heakins
I can't figure out where to put the call to @setEvalBranchQuota for code like this. The docs only show it used as part of a comptime block.

1523163903
tiehuis
heakins: not at the moment

1523163915
tiehuis
if you post your code i can help you figure out where to put it

1523163957
tiehuis
actually, with that particular line, you should just be able to turn it into a block expression and put set the branch quota there

1523163985
tiehuis
for example:

1523164132
heakins
tiehuis: Ah ok, is this block expression syntax documented?

1523164252
heakins
I see its something like: "comptime <tag>: { ...; break :<tag> <expression> }"

1523164306
tiehuis
not explicitly mentioned in the docs i don't think although it is used a few times

1523164322
MajorLag
it's kinda documented in the section on arrays

1523164329
tiehuis
and yeah like that, although of course it isn't strictly a comptime expression

1523164716
heakins
Great, that works

1523164719
heakins
thanks

Anyone know why i always have to provide --zig-install-prefix? I am using zig v0.2.0 from

1523169798
heakins
I've had a look at the source code for zig, and I see that it looks in the same directory as where the zig executable is, which should be right for my setup...

1523169884
heakins
When I try to use zig without --zig-install-prefix, and use strace to look at what files it's trying to open, I see this:

1523169905
heakins
access("/root/zig-bootstrap/out/stage1/lib/zig/std/index.zig", F_OK) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)

1523170158
heakins
Ah... I see that this has been fixed since 0.2.0.

1523170161
heakins
Nevermind

Hi all, what does it mean when a function parameter type is "var"?

1523188947
hobomatic
heakins: It's just means 'this can be of any type'. unlike normal parametric polymorphism though, you can use it for 'duck typing'; so long as the usage of the value in the function body would compile at the call site, the function call compiles.

1523189073
hobomatic
so you could do something like: fn foo(x: var) @typeOf(x) { return x + x; }, and anything with binary `+` is a valid argument.

1523192522
hobomatic
of course you have to be careful of implicit argument casts. Passing a stuct as x for instance casts it to &const StructTypedate

1523195075
MajorLag
ok, can anyone tell me what I did wrong with PR #904 that ci seems to be missing a file that definitely exists?

1523208819
andrewrk
heakins, right, I only got static builds working last week - after 0.2.0 was released. I went back and added a binary upload for 0.2.0 but it doesn't have the runtime install prefix detection

1523208856
andrewrk
MajorLag, I think you need to add it to CMakeLists.txt

1523208878
andrewrk
so that the build system knows to install it

1523212261
MajorLag
huh, ok.

1523212412
andrewrk
there are files in std/ that we don't install

1523212425
andrewrk
some of the compiler-rt tests are several megabytes

1523212524
MajorLag
yeah, I remember writing my appdir build script to remove them when building the tarball.

1523212848
andrewrk
I have 10 hours of uninterrupted time to work on zig today

1523212867
andrewrk
I hope to have the proof of concept async tcp server working by the end of it

1523212969
MajorLag
Nice. Spent 10 hours coding myself yesterday. I think it say something about Zig that I can do that and not feel drained.

1523212994
andrewrk
great :)

1523213237
MajorLag
I'm really quite pleased with zig. Even with the occasional bug and incomplete portions I still prefer it over everything else. So thanks for that.

1523213594
andrewrk
happy to hear that. you're working on a cross platform game, is that right?

1523213774
MajorLag
among other things. a tweening library, an operating environment on top of the linux kernel, other little things as they come up.

1523213831
andrewrk
you're making move.zig?

1523213836
MajorLag
indeed

1523213840
andrewrk
amazing

1523213933
MajorLag
actually, I think I've pretty much got most of it. Comptime can make something amazingly flexible. I've taken a break because the next step is writing display code to test it with. The interpoaltion portion was tested by dumping monochrome bitmaps but I'm not going to get away with anything that simple in this case.

1523214099
MajorLag
The tweening is inspired by LibGDX's stuff in Scene2D and bears some resemblance, but isn't a complete scenegraph implementation because I wanted to build it in more generic layers. Right now it is agnostic about the precise definition of an "actor" to which tweening actions can be applied. You can make a sprite actor, with x, y, scale, etc and have the actions act on those, or you can make them n-dimensional verte

1523214100
MajorLag
.

1523214137
andrewrk
is that something you would use in a game engine?

1523214378
MajorLag
yep. part of the reason I started building it was I wanted to finally add non-player entities, and because I'm not an artist I wanted to use a technique where I could compose them and animate them easily.

finally:

zig now has better stack traces than node.js for async code
