I looked at the sort function in std.sort and noticed it has helper functions like i32asc, i32desc, etc. for the lessThan parameter but they're not public. Anyone know if there are plans to have helper functions on it for primitive types? I didn't see anything on GitHub issues about it

1531284497
andrewrk
v1zix, we can make those public if it's helpful. feel free to make a PR

1531284518
andrewrk
it should be pretty trivial to define those things in the meantime

quick note about the sorting, you can create a generic comptime function for every type as needed which would be a bit cleaner

1531285844
tiehuis
for example:

1531285876
andrewrk
nice!

1531285879
tiehuis
also, would it be worthwhile to change the compare func arguments from *const T to T since the change to how parameters are passed?

1531285893
andrewrk
yes I believe that was one of the main motivations

1531285915
tiehuis
Might make a quick PR tonight to apply both those changes then

1531285950
andrewrk
sounds good, I'll have a look at it in the morning (the morning for me at least)

1531285966
tiehuis
also, got that struct idea from tgschultz in the nested function issue

1531285977
andrewrk
I really should prioritize that defer scope issue

1531285993
andrewrk
where zig tries to generate defers of outer functions for inner functions

1531286016
tiehuis
sounds odd, don't think I've come across that yet

1531286039
andrewrk


1531286074
tiehuis
also, i'm thinking i'll add a `--stdin` flag to `zig fmt` since many formatters seem to work a bit nicer when the control the buffer themselves for autoformatting

1531286094
andrewrk
sounds reasonable

1531286136
andrewrk
tiehuis, have you seen the event loop stuff?

1531286139
andrewrk
I'm quite excited about it

1531286232
v1zix
tiehuis, very cool! Yeah I thought there might be a way to essentially return a `fn` with a generic function, but wasn't sure on the syntax

1531286332
tiehuis
andrewrk: yes! very exciting, will be very cool to see how the self-hosted compiler design continues and the end result

1531286844

I'm getting a segfault inside nvidia's vulkan driver for the following zig code but not the equivalent C code. Here is zig:

1531319850
unique_id
The c code returns success

1531319870
unique_id
I don't really know how to debug this

1531320163
unique_id
"pNext = true" says the debugger, wait a second .........

1531320173
unique_id
But I'm setting it to pNext = null

1531320919
unique_id
I'm having a hard time debugging the zig code because even right after explicitly setting info.pNext to null, the debugger prints that info.pNext is 'true'. So... is code gen at fault here? I don't know.

1531322803
bheads
try making VkInstanceCreateInfo a packed struct

1531323013
bheads
Anything you share with C whould be packed

1531323505
wilsonk
Zig also doesn't allow assigning null to something that can't be null...not sure if this holds while true debugging, but it is a language feature that keeps one from shooting oneself in the foot. See

1531323801
unique_id
wilsonk: What did I assign null that couldn't be null?

1531323891
unique_id
bheads: then why does zig translate-c use extern structs extensively?

1531323982
bheads
not sure, extern struct is not documented :/ But I have had success with packed structs

1531324142
wilsonk
unique_id: just saying that maybe pNext can't be null in the context you are trying to set it...not sure though. Compiler magic might be possible there, is all

1531324327
unique_id
ah okay, I'm not :)

1531324343
unique_id
and I set it in code, not in the debugger

1531324481

Ah, I see. My bad

1531324656
andrewrk
I'm looking at your pastes now

1531324871
andrewrk
unique_id, bheads is incorrect about using packed for sharing with C

1531324887
andrewrk
apologies for the lack of documentation - I will address that today - but `extern struct` guarantees ABI compatibility with C

1531325032
andrewrk
unique_id, how are you linking against vulkan?

1531325108
unique_id
I do: exe.linkSystemLibrary("vulkan")

1531325118
unique_id
-lvulkan for gcc

1531325139
andrewrk
oh, did you also do libc btw?

1531325147
andrewrk
exe.linkSystemLibrary("c")

1531325151
unique_id
I did

1531325206
andrewrk
hm. I'm not sure what library to install to do that - I get lld: error: unable to find library -lvulkan

1531325218
andrewrk
I thought you had to use one of those dynamic loaders

1531325309
unique_id
Yeah I was also getting that. Linking "c" makes it find vulkan, why I don't know

1531325377
unique_id
No, you can link vulkan. "volk is a meta-loader for Vulkan. It allows you to dynamically load entrypoints required to use Vulkan without linking to vulkan-1.dll or statically linking Vulkan loader."

1531325412
unique_id
but you can use things like volk for a slight perf improvement as well as better errors to users, I guess

hey just announcing i've been working on a game boy emulator. so far just implemented cpu and instruction set. have to work on graphics and audio but docs on this are pretty unclear. if anyone is interested, here it is:

obviously written in zig

cool, always nice to have more zig code to look at!

1531325693

isaachier, awesome!

1531325724
andrewrk
unique_id, are you planning on using glfw, sdl, or something else?

1531325728
isaachier
thanks!

1531325759
isaachier
relating to SDL, that's what i decided to use too. pretty much works out of the box AFAIK.

1531325887
andrewrk
isaachier, if you add a readme I'll link it on ziglang.org

1531325960

@andrewrk: Just for extra confirmation, if you search for "Vulkan Direct Exports" on this page:

1531326004
unique_id
Having said that, and I should have said this sooner, I've also tried using dlopen and it didn't fix my issue

1531326124
unique_id
nvm, I still used dlsym so I still went through the loader library

1531326498
andrewrk
unique_id, makes sense. I'm just trying to duplicate your setup so I can debug

1531326638
andrewrk
got it! confirmed, I can reproduce the problem

1531326782
andrewrk
I made an issue:

1531326850
unique_id
awesome, I'm excited to see the bug :)

1531327162
andrewrk
looks like zig is generating pNext as a `bool` when it should be a pointer

1531327207
andrewrk
ohhh, it's `?*const void` instead of `?*const c_void`

1531327212
andrewrk
that's a really unfortunate footgun

1531327225
andrewrk
I think I can simply make this a compile error - not allowing pointer to void in extern structs

1531327257
andrewrk
ok that fixes it

1531327349
unique_id
are you sure that fixes it? I don't remember exactly what I was doing but I was also changing void and c_void around, trying things, which didn't seem to affect anything.

1531327417
unique_id
oh it worked

1531327495
unique_id
maybe the issue is unnecessary then

1531327531
andrewrk
unique_id, it should be a compile error - I'll make that be the case before closing the issue

1531327540
unique_id
ok so when I was changing void and c_void around I was dealing with some different issue

1531327541
andrewrk
this is a great example of a foot gun that we don't want zig to have

1531327657

1531328027

appveyor tests the examples on windows on every master branch push

1531328248

Appveyor then builds a zip file.  Easy to download, extract and run it.  Very nice.

1531328539

I feel silly not having read about void sooner. The c++ people have been talking about having something like this. Definitely useful for generic code.

1531328648

I am trying to build tetris on Windows.  I see that I need libepoxy, GLFW, and libpng.  Where do I put them so zig can link to them?

1531328809
andrewrk
douglasC_, I've only ever been able to cross compile tetris for windows - there's an open issue for doing it natively:

1531328839
douglasC_
Ok, I will try in Linux and cross compile.

1531328862
andrewrk
but I haven't tried too hard. you should be able to put them anywhere, and then the problem is just adding to the build script the libraries where they can be found

1531328903
isaachier
Thanks @andrewrk! I added a really basic README with just the description, but I'll let you know when I do a more thorough one.

1531329166
andrewrk
douglasC_, libpng is a regrettable dependency on windows

1531329208
andrewrk
I'd love to see a pure zig png library

1531329225
douglasC_
andrewrk: i do not see any prebuilt libpng.  Can it be built with VS?

1531329248
andrewrk
when I did it, I obtained it with the mxe project:
