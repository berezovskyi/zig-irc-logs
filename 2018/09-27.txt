fun fact: no C time functions used. Screw that nonsense.

It's just a binary thing, tracks when I've been programming and when I haven't. Single purpose. No need to pretend I've made something cool, thought I'd share anyway haha!

I am interested in anything with more zig code to learn from :)  I also use pomodoro, with 50m/10m intervals

edr: Nice. I may open source at a later date, though there's other things I'd probably rather want to open source. I think I've used 40 or 45 minute intervals in the past.

I don't know, I've been waiting on twitch, and Adrew seems that he really quit twitter, so I'm in the dark :/

On the other hand I see that the last commit to zig was 2 hours ago, and all 0.3 issues have been closed, so maybe he is tired today, he has done it!

andrewrk
oops, I just looked at the clock

I intended to stream, but I've been slogging through these release notes all day

1538082764
andrewrk
I think I'll skip today

allochi
Man, you deserve some time to rest, you have been pushing 0.3 hard...

1538082816
allochi

andrewrk
allochi, I realized, that it was just my ad blocker that was broken for some reason, and it now seems to be working again. so I might get back on :)

1538082845
allochi

1538082869
allochi

1538082912
