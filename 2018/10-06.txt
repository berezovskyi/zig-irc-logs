Hey!

I'm trying to interface with C, but it's getting annoying because *T won't cast to [*]T, am I doing something wrong here?

1538836398

Currently I'm having to @ptrCast, which makes stuff pretty unreadable

Also, there's a struct which has a member named 'type' - when I try to access this, the language thinks I'm getting the type of the struct

(because I have to write out my_struct.type)

Oh, ignore that last bit, i was just reading the error wrong;)

This seems to be a problem in general with C pointers, they're all [*], so I can't just access fields on them normally without putting [0] afterwards

if you have a function, that takes a buff, and writes from the BACK of the buffer to the beginning of the buffer, using 2 loops,

1 unrolled loop, writing in chunks of 4,

and 1 fixup loop

would you check if the buffer has a length of 0 at the start of the function? or would you write the loop condition so they dont run at a length of 0?

here is a little example function, it writes the digits of a number into a buffer:

are defered statements always run when you run a coro?

*cancel a coro
