hey all, quick question - how would you assert on the error from a !void function?

I'm doing `const val = try my_function(); assert(val == error.MyError)` but I'm getting `operator not allowed for type '@typeOf(bf_interp).ReturnType.ErrorSet!void'` on the equality operator

Hejsil, welcome to the internet, where people will endlessly complain about the most meaningless details. It is interesting that "Go" was the example, seeing as it is literally impossible to use Allman style bracing in Go.

andrewrk: translate-c doesn't handle bitfields (converts to @OpaqueType), but from what I can tell it totally could, using packed structs with @IntTypes. Is this just not handled yet, or is there a good reason not to do that that I'm missing? Nearest I can figure the only real issue with it is that you might have to cast the @IntType when you use it.

MajorLag, your analysis of translate-c with regards to bit fields is correct

it's just not handled yet
