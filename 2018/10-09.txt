Hi folks, I've got a question: is there a reason to why all built-in functions are prefixed with a @? As in: why would you need to distinguish them from regular functions at a glance?

doctorgester, it helps you read code quickly

you don't have to know the whole set of compiler builtin function to know whether a function is a compiler builtin or not

pancake, to follow up from our conversation yesterday

zig build-exe ../example/hello_world/hello.zig --release-small --strip --static

ls -hl hello

I solved the issue that I mentioned, plus disabled PIC when building a static exe

doctorgester, forgot to add, it's also a namespace. so we don't need something like `__builtin_` prefixing all the functions

and the addition and removal of compiler builtin functions is non-breaking

*just addition is non-breaking
