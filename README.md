This repository hosts the IRC logs for the `#zig` channel on irc.libera.chat.  Logs are stord in `year/month-day.txt` (years are subfolders to keep directories from getting too many entries).

At the end of each day, a new commit is added to the repo with all the new messages for that day, along with a new branch that contains a file just for that day.  This makes it easy for clients to download the entire history, or individual days.
